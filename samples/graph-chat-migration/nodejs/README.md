* Teams Bots.

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) latest version or equivalent tunnelling solution
- [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) or [TeamsFx CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/teamsfx-cli?pivots=version-one)

## Run the app (Using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio Code)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio Code.

1. Ensure you have downloaded and installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)
1. Install the [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension)
1. Select **File > Open Folder** in VS Code and choose this samples directory from the repo
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the app in a Teams web client.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.
1. Make sure to add the aad **userid** in the **.localConfigs** file and also make sure the user is part of the group chat or channel where you want to migrate the messages.

> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (uploading), Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

## Run the app (Manually Uploading to Teams)

> Note these instructions are for running the sample on your local machine, the tunnelling solution is required because
the Teams service needs to call into the bot.

1) Run ngrok - point to port 3978

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

## Setup for bot
In Azure portal, create a [Azure Bot resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration).
    - For bot handle, make up a name.
    - Select "Use existing app registration" (Create the app registration in Microsoft Entra ID beforehand.)
    - __*If you don't have an Azure account*__ create an [Azure free account here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
    
   In the new Azure Bot resource in the Portal, 
    - Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
    - In Settings/Configuration/Messaging endpoint, enter the current `https` URL you were given by running the tunneling application. Append with the path `/api/messages`

## Setup for code
1) Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

1) In a terminal, navigate to `samples/bot-graph-chat-migration/nodejs`

1) Install modules

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

1) Update the `.env` configuration for the bot to use the Microsoft App Id and App Password from the Bot Framework registration. (Note the App Password is referred to as the "client secret" in the azure portal and you can always create a new client secret anytime.) `MicrosoftAppTenantId` will be the id for the tenant where application is registered.
 - Also, set MicrosoftAppType in the `.env`. (**Allowed values are: MultiTenant(default), SingleTenant, UserAssignedMSI**)

1) Run your bot at the command line:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

1) __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the  `appManifest` folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your bot earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID>>` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` with base Url domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `appManifest` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)
    - **Upload** the `manifest.zip` to Teams (In Teams Apps/Manage your apps click "Upload an app". Browse to and Open the .zip file. At the next dialog, click the Add button.)
    - Add the app to personal/team/groupChat scope (Supported scopes)
   
**Note**: If you are facing any issue in your app, please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/bot-conversation/nodejs/index.js#L46) line and put your debugger for local debug.
