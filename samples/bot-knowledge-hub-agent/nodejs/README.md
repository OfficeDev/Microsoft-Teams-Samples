# Overview of the Basic AI Chatbot template

This app template is built on top of [Teams AI library V2](https://aka.ms/teams-ai-library-v2). 
It showcases an agent app that responds to user questions like ChatGPT, which enables your users to talk with the AI agent in Teams.

## Get started with the template

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run the template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 20, 22.
> - [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) latest version or [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-toolkit-cli).
> - Prepare your own [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/oai/access) resource.

> For local debugging using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI, you need to do some extra steps described in [Set up your Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI for local debugging](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli-debugging).

1. First, select the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
1. In file *env/.env.playground.user*, fill in your Azure OpenAI key `SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>`, endpoint `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=<your-endpoint>`, and deployment name `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<your-deployment>`.
1. Press F5 to start debugging which launches your app in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground using a web browser. Select `Debug in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground`.
1. You can send any message to get a response from the agent.

**Congratulations**! You are running an application that can now interact with users in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground:
