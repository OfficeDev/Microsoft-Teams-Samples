> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The existing Microsoft 365 (previously called Office 365) connectors across all cloud platforms are nearing deprecation, and the creation of new Microsoft 365 connectors will soon be blocked. For more information on the schedule and how the Workflows app provides a more flexible and secure experience, see [retirement of Microsoft 365 connectors within Microsoft Teams](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/retirement-of-office-365-connectors-within-microsoft-teams/).

# Incoming webhook

This sample demonstrates a Teams tab where users can input Incoming Webhook URLs and send message cards to a specified Teams channel, illustrating the HttpPOST action for interactive message cards. It includes setup steps for running the sample, testing in multiple environments such as Outlook and Office, and provides insights into webhooks and connectors for extending Microsoft 365 apps.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 6.0

  ```bash
  # determine dotnet version
  dotnet --version
  ```
- Publicly addressable https url or tunnel such as [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) latest version or [Tunnel Relay](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-tunnelrelay) 

- [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com) Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account

- [Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)

## Run the app (Using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio.
1. Install Visual Studio 2022 **Version 17.10 Preview 4 or higher** [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
1. Install Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio [Teams Toolkit extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)
1. In the debug dropdown menu of Visual Studio, select Dev Tunnels > Create A Tunnel (set authentication type to Public) or select an existing public dev tunnel.
1. In the debug dropdown menu of Visual Studio, select default startup project > **Microsoft Teams (browser)**
1. In Visual Studio, right-click your **TeamsApp** project and **Select Teams Toolkit > Prepare Teams App Dependencies**
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps.
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the menu in Visual Studio.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.
> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (sideloading), Teams Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

## Setup

### 1. Setup for incoming webhook

1) Create a incoming webhook. [Create incoming webhooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook). Keep this webhook URL handy while running the sample.

### 2. Setup NGROK
1) Run ngrok - point to port 3978

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

### 3. Setup for code

1) Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
   ```

1) In a terminal, navigate to `samples/incoming-webhook/csharp/ClientApp`

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    If you face any dependency error while installing node modules, try using below command

    ```bash
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```

1) In a terminal, navigate to `samples/incoming-webhook/csharp`

    ```bash
    # change into project folder
    cd # IncomingWebhook
    ```

1) Run the app from a terminal or from Visual Studio, choose option A or B.

  A) From a terminal

  ```bash
  # run the app
  dotnet run
  ```

  B) Or from Visual Studio

  - Launch Visual Studio
  - File -> Open -> Project/Solution
  - Navigate to `IncomingWebhook` folder
  - Select `IncomingWebhook.csproj` file
  - Press `F5` to run the project

### 4. Setup Manifest for Teams
1) __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the  `appPackage` folder to replace `{{Manifest-id}}` with any `GUID` ID.
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `contentUrl`, `websiteUrl` inside `staticTabs` section. Replace `<<Domain-name>>` with app's base Url domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.
    - **Note:** If you want to test your app across multi hub like: Outlook/Office.com, please update the `manifest.json` in the `incoming-webhook\csharp\IncomingWebhook\Manifest_Hub` folder with the required values.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `appPackage` folder to create a `Manifest.zip` or `Manifest_Hub` folder to create a `Manifest_Hub.zip`(Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)
    - **Upload** the `manifest.zip` to Teams (In Teams Apps/Manage your apps click "Upload an app". Browse to and Open the .zip file. At the next dialog, click the Add button.)
    - Add the app to personal scope.


## Running the sample

## Outlook on the web

- To view your app in Outlook on the web.

- Go to [Outlook on the web](https://outlook.office.com/mail/)and sign in using your dev tenant account.

**On the side bar, select More Apps. Your sideloaded app title appears among your installed apps**

**Note:** Similarly, you can test your application in the Outlook desktop app as well.

## Office on the web

- To preview your app running in Office on the web.

- Log into office.com with test tenant credentials

**Select the Apps icon on the side bar. Your sideloaded app title appears among your installed apps**
