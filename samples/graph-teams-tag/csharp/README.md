# Graph teams tag

This sample application illustrates how to implement CRUD operations for team tags using the Microsoft Graph API within a Microsoft Teams tab. Users can easily create, update, and manage tags, with full integration of Teams Single Sign-On (SSO) and Graph API functionalities, providing a complete solution for teamwork and collaboration.

## Included Features
* Teams SSO (tabs)
* Graph API
* Teamwork Tags

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account (not a guest account)
-  .[NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) SDK.
    ```bash
        # determine dotnet version
        dotnet --version
    ```
-  [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) latest version or equivalent tunneling solution
-  [M365 developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) or access to a Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app.
- [Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)

## Run the app (Using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio.
1. Install Visual Studio 2022 **Version 17.10 Preview 4  or higher** [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
1. Install Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio [Teams Toolkit extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)
1. In the debug dropdown menu of Visual Studio, select default startup project > **Microsoft Teams (browser)**
1. In Visual Studio, right-click your **TeamsApp** project and **Select Teams Toolkit > Prepare Teams App Dependencies**
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps.
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the menu in Visual Studio.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.
> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (sideloading), Teams Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

## Setup


1. Register a new application in the [Microsoft Entra ID – App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.
2. On the overview page, copy and save the **Application (client) ID, Directory (tenant) ID**. You’ll need those later when updating your Teams application manifest and in the appsettings.json.
3. Navigate to **API Permissions**, and make sure to add the follow permissions:
-   Select Add a permission
-   Select Microsoft Graph -> Application permissions.
   - `TeamworkTag.ReadWrite.All`

-   Click on Add permissions. Please make sure to grant the admin consent for the required permissions.

4.  Navigate to the **Certificates & secrets**. In the Client secrets section, click on "+ New client secret". Add a description (Name of the secret) for the secret and select “Never” for Expires. Click "Add". Once the client secret is created, copy its value, it need to be placed in the appsettings.json file.

> Note these instructions are for running the sample on your local machine, the tunnelling solution is required because
> the Teams service needs to call into the app.


5. Start tunnel on localhost:3978
   - If you are using Ngrok, Open ngrok and run command `ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"` 
   -  Once started you should see link `https://xxxxx.ngrok-free.app`. Copy it, this is your baseUrl that will used as endpoint for Azure bot.
   
   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

6. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
   ```

  - Launch Visual Studio
   - File -> Open -> Project/Solution
   - Navigate to folder where repository is cloned then `samples/graph-teams-tag/csharp/GraphTeamsTag.sln`  
 

  - Update appsettings.json
   Update configuration with the ```MicrosoftAppId```,  ```MicrosoftAppPassword``` and ```MicrosoftAppTenantId``` with the values generated while doing Microsoft Entra ID app registration in Azure Portal.

 - Run the bot from Visual Studio: 
   - Press `F5` to run the project

7. Setup the `manifest.json` in the `/appPackage` folder 
Replace the following details:
- `{{APP-ID}}` with any GUID id value or your MicrosoftAppId.
- `{{BASE-URL}}` with base Url domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.
- **Zip** up the contents of the `appPackage` folder to create a `manifest.zip`
- **Upload** the `manifest.zip` to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")

## Running the sample

**User can see list of tags created for the current team.**
