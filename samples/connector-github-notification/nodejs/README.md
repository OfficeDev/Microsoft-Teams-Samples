> The existing Microsoft 365 (previously called Office 365) connectors across all cloud platforms are nearing deprecation, and the creation of new Microsoft 365 connectors will soon be blocked. For more information on the schedule and how the Workflows app provides a more flexible and secure experience, see [retirement of Microsoft 365 connectors within Microsoft Teams](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/retirement-of-office-365-connectors-within-microsoft-teams/).

# GitHub Connector for Microsoft Teams

This is an example to show how to write a connector for Microsoft Teams using GitHub's APIs. It is not the source code for the GitHub connector in Teams/Outlook/Yammer.
 
#### Prerequisites
1. Register a new OAuth application at GitHub. Note the GitHub client id and secret.
2. If you want to run this code locally, use a tunnelling service like [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) latest version.
3. If you are using Ngrok as a tunnelling service then download ngrok from https://ngrok.com/. Run the following command to setup a tunnel to localhost:3000
 `ngrok http 3000`
 Note the ngrok address, which looks something like `https://013e0d3f.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels, your URL will be like: https://12345.devtunnels.ms.
3. Put the callback Url in the Oauth app as 'your-ngrok/auth/github/callback'.
4. Replace the clientId,clientSecret,callbackUrl and serviceUrl in Default.json.

### Configuration 
 - Default configuration is in `config\default.json`
 
### How to Run
 - install all the dependencies through npm install.
 - run node server.js.
 - Zip manifest.json file and sideload to any team. Alternative you can set your own connector at Microsoft connector portal (https://outlook.office.com/connectors/publish) and follow instructions here to get a new connector for microsoft teams ( https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/connectors).
