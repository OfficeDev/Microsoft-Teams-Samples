## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account (not a guest account)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) latest version or equivalent tunnelling solution
- [M365 developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) or access to a Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app.
- [Teams Toolkit for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) or [TeamsFx CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/teamsfx-cli?pivots=version-one)

## Run the app (Using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code.

1. Ensure you have downloaded and installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)
1. Install the [Teams Toolkit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension)
1. Select **File > Open Folder** in VS Code and choose this samples directory from the repo
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the app in a Teams web client.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.

## Setup

### 1. Setup for App Registration

1. Register a new application in the [Microsoft Entra ID – App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.
2. Select **New Registration** and on the *register an application page*, set following values:
    * Set **name** to your app name.
    * Choose the **supported account types** (any account type will work)
    * Leave **Redirect URI** empty.
    * Choose **Register**.
3. On the overview page, copy and save the **Application (client) ID, Directory (tenant) ID**. You’ll need those later when updating your Teams application manifest and in the appsettings.json.
4. Under **Manage**, select **Expose an API**. 
5. Select the **Set** link to generate the Application ID URI in the form of `api://{AppID}`. Insert your fully qualified domain name (with a forward slash "/" appended to the end) between the double forward slashes and the GUID. The entire ID should have the form of: `api://fully-qualified-domain-name/{AppID}`
    * ex: `api://%ngrokDomain%.ngrok-free.app/{{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}}`.
6. Select the **Add a scope** button. In the panel that opens, enter `access_as_user` as the **Scope name**.
7. Set **Who can consent?** to `Admins and users`
8. Fill in the fields for configuring the admin and user consent prompts with values that are appropriate for the `access_as_user` scope:
    * **Admin consent title:** Teams can access the user’s profile.
    * **Admin consent description**: Allows Teams to call the app’s web APIs as the current user.
    * **User consent title**: Teams can access the user profile and make requests on the user's behalf.
    * **User consent description:** Enable Teams to call this app’s APIs with the same rights as the user.
9. Ensure that **State** is set to **Enabled**
10. Select **Add scope**
    * The domain part of the **Scope name** displayed just below the text field should automatically match the **Application ID** URI set in the previous step, with `/access_as_user` appended to the end:
        * `api://[ngrokDomain].ngrok-free.app/[App-id]/access_as_user.
11. In the **Authorized client applications** section, identify the applications that you want to authorize for your app’s web application. Each of the following IDs needs to be entered:
    * `1fec8e78-bce4-4aaf-ab1b-5451cc387264` (Teams mobile/desktop application)
    * `5e3ce6c0-2b1f-4285-8d4b-75ee78787346` (Teams web application)
12. Navigate to **API Permissions**, and make sure to add the follow permissions:
-   Select Add a permission
-   Select Microsoft Graph -\> Delegated permissions.
    - `Chat.Read`
    - `Chat.ReadWrite`
    - `ChatMessage.Send`
-   Click on Add permissions. Please make sure to grant the admin consent for the required permissions.
13. Navigate to **Authentication**
    If an app hasn't been granted IT admin consent, users will have to provide consent the first time they use an app.
- Set a redirect URI:
    * Select **Add a platform**.
    * Select **Single Page Application**.
    * Enter the **redirect URI** for the app in the following format: `https://{Base_Url_Domain}/auth-end`. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your `{Base_Url_Domain}` will be`1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be `12345.devtunnels.ms`.
14.  Navigate to the **Certificates & secrets**. In the Client secrets section, click on "+ New client secret". Add a description(Name of the secret) for the secret and select “Never” for Expires. Click "Add". Once the client secret is created, copy its value, it need to be placed in the env file.

### 2. Setup NGROK
1) Run ngrok - point to port 3978

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

### 3. Setup for code

### 1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
   ```

1) In the folder where repository is cloned navigate to `samples/graph-pinned-messages/nodejs`

1) Update the `.env` configuration with the ```MicrosoftAppId```,  ```MicrosoftAppPassword``` and ```MicrosoftAppTenantId``` with values generated in step 1 while doing App Registration.

**Note: Navigate to samples\graph-pinned-messages\nodejs\ClientApp\src\components\dashboard.jsx**
       - On line 88, replace {{ChatId}}  

### 3.1. Install node modules and run server 

 Inside node js folder (samples/graph-pinned-messages/nodejs), open your local terminal and run the below command to install node modules. You can do the same in Visual studio code terminal by opening the project in Visual studio code 

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm start
```

If you face any dependency error while installing node modules, try using below command

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 3.2. Install node modules and run client 

 Navigate to `samples/graph-pinned-messages/nodejs/ClientApp` folder, Open your local terminal and run the below command to install node modules. You can do the same in Visual studio code terminal by opening the project in Visual studio code 

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

```bash
npm start
```

If you face any dependency error while installing node modules, try using below command

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```
    
### 4. Setup Manifest for Teams
1) __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the  `appManifest` folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your app earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID>>` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `configurationUrl` inside `configurableTabs` . Replace `{{BASE-URL-DOMAIN}}` with your app's base Url domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your base url domain will be `1234.ngrok-free.app`.
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` with base Url domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `appManifest` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)
    - **Upload** the `manifest.zip` to Teams (In Teams Apps/Manage your apps click "Upload an app". Browse to and Open the .zip file. At the next dialog, click the Add button.)
    - **Note** Add the app to groupChat scope.
