## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account (not a guest account)
- [csharp](https://csharp.org/en/)
- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) (For local environment testing) latest version (any other tunneling software can also be used).
- [M365 developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) or access to a Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app.
- [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)



`SECRET_AZURE_OPENAPI_KEY=<Azure OpenAI Service Key>`

`CHAT_COMPLETION_MODEL_NAME=gpt-3.5-turbo`

> Note: If you are deploying the code, make sure that above mentioned values are properly updated at `env/.env.dev` or `env/.env.dev.user` wherever required.

## Run the app (Using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio.
1. Install Visual Studio 2022 **Version 17.14 or higher** [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
1. Install Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)
1. In the debug dropdown menu of Visual Studio, select Dev Tunnels > Create A Tunnel (set authentication type to Public) or select an existing public dev tunnel.
1. In the debug dropdown menu of Visual Studio, select default startup project > **Microsoft Teams (browser)**
1. Right-click the 'M365Agent' project in Solution Explorer and select **Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit > Select Microsoft 365 Account**
1. Sign in to Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit with a **Microsoft 365 work or school account**
1. Set `Startup Item` as `Microsoft Teams (browser)`.
1. Press F5, or select Debug > Start Debugging menu in Visual Studio to start your app

1. In the opened web browser, select Add button to install the app in Teams

> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (uploading), Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

## Setup

> Note these instructions are for running the sample on your local machine, the tunnelling solution is required because
the Teams service needs to call into the bot.

1) Run ngrok - point to port 3978

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

2) App Registration

### Register your application with Azure AD

1. Register a new application in the [Microsoft Entra ID – App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.
2. Select **New Registration** and on the *register an application page*, set following values:
    * Set **name** to your app name.
    * Choose the **supported account types** (any account type will work)
    * Leave **Redirect URI** empty.
    * Choose **Register**.
3. On the overview page, copy and save the **Application (client) ID, Directory (tenant) ID**. You'll need those later when updating your Teams application manifest and in the appsettings.json.
4. Navigate to **API Permissions**, and make sure to add the follow permissions:
    * Select Add a permission
    * Select Microsoft Graph -> Delegated permissions.
    * `User.Read` (enabled by default)
    * Click on Add permissions. Please make sure to grant the admin consent for the required permissions.

### 3. Setup for Bot

   In Azure portal, create a [Azure Bot resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration).
    - For bot handle, make up a name.
    - Select "Use existing app registration" (Create the app registration in Microsoft Entra ID beforehand.)
    - Choose "Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant)" in Authentication section in your App Registration to run this sample smoothly.
    - __*If you don't have an Azure account*__ create an [Azure free account here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
    - In the new Azure Bot resource in the Portal, Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
    - In Settings/Configuration/Messaging endpoint, enter the current `https` URL you were given by running the tunnelling application. Append with the path `/api/messages`


### 4. Setup for code
  
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
   ```

2. Open the code in Visual Studio
   - File -> Open -> Project/Solution
   - Navigate to folder where repository is cloned then `samples/msgext-ai-sentiment-analysis/csharp/MEAISentimentAnalysis.sln`
   

1) Update the `appSettings.json` configuration for the bot to use the `MicrosoftAppId`, `SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY` and `ApplicationBaseUrl`  with application base url. For e.g., your ngrok or dev tunnels url. (Note the MicrosoftAppId is the AppId created in step 1 (Setup for Bot), the MicrosoftAppPassword is referred to as the "client secret" in step 1 (Setup for Bot) and you can always create a new client secret anytime.)

> Note: If you dont have access to Azure Open Api Key then use `Open Api key`. 

- Press `F5` to run the project.

5. Setup Manifest for Teams
- __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the ./appPackage folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your app registration earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `{{Microsoft-App-Id}}` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` and replace `{{domain-name}}` with base Url of your domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `appPackage` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)
