# Get Checkin info of user

The App Check-In Location sample demonstrates a feature that allows users to check in from their current location and view all previous check-ins using a bot. This functionality is particularly beneficial for tracking attendance and user engagement within the Microsoft Teams environment.

`Currently, Microsoft Teams support for get geolocation capability is only available for mobile clients`

## Included Features
* Bots
* Adaptive Cards
* Task Modules
* Device Permission API (Location)

## Interaction with app

## Try it yourself - experience the App in your Microsoft Teams client
Please find below demo manifest which is deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading the app package (.zip file link below) to your teams and/or as a personal app. (Uploading must be enabled for your tenant, [see steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)).

**App check-in location:** [Manifest](/samples/app-checkin-location/csharp/demo-manifest/App-checkin-location.zip)

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account (not a guest account)
- To test locally, [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) must be installed on your development machine (version 16.14.2  or higher)
- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) latest version or equivalent tunneling solution
- [M365 developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) or access to a Teams account with the 
   appropriate permissions to install an app.
- [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) or [TeamsFx CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/teamsfx-cli?pivots=version-one)

## Run the app (Using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio Code)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio Code.

1. Ensure you have downloaded and installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)
1. Install the [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension)
1. Select **File > Open Folder** in VS Code and choose this samples directory from the repo
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the app in a Teams web client.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.

> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (uploading), Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

## Setup

> Note these instructions are for running the sample on your local machine, the tunnelling solution is required because
> the Teams service needs to call into the bot.

### 1. Setup for Bot
- In Azure portal, create a [Azure Bot resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-authentication?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp%2Caadv2).
- Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
- While registering the bot, use `https://<your_tunnel_domain>/api/messages` as the messaging endpoint.
**NOTE:** When you create app registration, you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.

### 2. Setup NGROK
1) Run ngrok - point to port 3978

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

### 3. Setup for code
1) Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

2) In a terminal, navigate to `samples/app-checkin-location/nodejs`

3) Install modules

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4) Update the `.env` configuration for the bot to use the `MicrosoftAppId` and `MicrosoftAppPassword`, `BaseUrl` with application base url. For e.g., your ngrok url. (Note the MicrosoftAppId is the AppId created in step 1 (Setup for Bot), the MicrosoftAppPassword is referred to as the "client secret" in step 1 (Setup for Bot) and you can always create a new client secret anytime.)

5) Run your app

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
**Note**: If you are facing any issue in your app, please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/app-checkin-location/nodejs/index.js#L48) line and put your debugger for local debug.

### 4. Setup Manifest for Teams

- **This step is specific to Teams.**
    - Edit the `manifest.json` contained in the `appManifest/` folder to replace with your MicrosoftAppId (that was created in step1.1 and is the same value of MicrosoftAppId in `.env` file) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `{MicrosoftAppId}` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - Zip up the contents of the `appManifest/` folder to create a `manifest.zip`
    - Upload the `manifest.zip` to Teams (in the left-bottom *Apps* view, click "Upload a custom app")

### Register your app with Azure AD.

  1. Register a new application in the [Microsoft Entra ID – App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.
  2. Select **New Registration** and on the *register an application page*, set following values:
      * Set **name** to your app name.
      * Choose the **supported account types** (any account type will work)
      * Leave **Redirect URI** empty.
      * Choose **Register**.
  3. On the overview page, copy and save the **Application (client) ID, Directory (tenant) ID**. You'll need those later when updating your Teams application manifest and in the appsettings.json.
  4. Navigate to **API Permissions**, and make sure to add the follow permissions:
   Select Add a permission
      * Select Add a permission
      * Select Microsoft Graph -\> Delegated permissions.
      * `User.Read` (enabled by default)
      * Click on Add permissions. Please make sure to grant the admin consent for the required permissions.
