# Channel life cycle using Node js

This sample application illustrates the complete lifecycle of channels in Microsoft Teams, leveraging the Graph API to enable creating, updating, and deleting channels. Developed with Node.js, it includes features like tab integration and RSC permissions, along with detailed setup instructions for registration, tunneling, and deployment using the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio Code.

## Included Features
* Tabs
* Graph API
* RSC Permissions

## Try it yourself - experience the App in your Microsoft Teams client
Please find below demo manifest which is deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading the app package (.zip file link below) to your teams and/or as a personal app. (Sideloading must be enabled for your tenant, [see steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)).

**Channel life cycle:** [Manifest](/samples/graph-channel-lifecycle/csharp/demo-manifest/graph-channel-lifecycle.zip)


## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account (not a guest account)
- To test locally, [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) must be installed on your development machine (version 16.14.2  or higher)
- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) latest version or equivalent tunneling solution
- [M365 developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) or access to a Teams account with the 
- [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) or [TeamsFx CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/teamsfx-cli?pivots=version-one)

## Run the app (Using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio Code)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio Code.

1. Ensure you have downloaded and installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)
1. Install the [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension)
1. Select **File > Open Folder** in VS Code and choose this samples directory from the repo
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the app in a Teams web client.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.

> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (uploading), Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

### Register your app with Azure AD.

  1. Register a new application in the [Microsoft Entra ID – App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.
  2. Select **New Registration** and on the *register an application page*, set following values:
      * Set **name** to your app name.
      * Choose the **supported account types** (any account type will work)
      * Leave **Redirect URI** empty.
      * Choose **Register**.
  3. On the overview page, copy and save the **Application (client) ID, Directory (tenant) ID**. You'll need those later when updating your Teams application manifest and in the appsettings.json.
  4. Navigate to **API Permissions**, and make sure to add the follow permissions:
   Select Add a permission
      * Select Add a permission
      * Select Microsoft Graph -\> Delegated permissions.
      * `User.Read` (enabled by default)
      * Click on Add permissions. Please make sure to grant the admin consent for the required permissions.


## Setup.
1. Register a new application in the [Microsoft Entra ID – App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.
  - Your app must be registered in the Azure AD portal to integrate with the Microsoft identity platform and call Microsoft Graph APIs. See [Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2).
**NOTE:** When you create app registration, you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.

2. Setup NGROK
 - Run ngrok - point to port 3978

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

3. Setup for code
  - Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```
  - In a terminal, navigate to `samples/graph-channel-lifecycle/nodejs
 
 - Update the `.env` configuration with the Microsoft `ClientId` and `ClientSecret`

- Install modules

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
 - Run your bot at the command line:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
 4. Setup Manifest for Teams

- **This step is specific to Teams.**
    - Edit the `manifest.json` contained in the `appManifest/` folder to replace with your MicrosoftAppId (that was created in step1.1 and is the same value of MicrosoftAppId in `.env` file) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `{MicrosoftAppId}` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
   
    - Zip up the contents of the `appManifest/` folder to create a `manifest.zip`
    - Upload the `manifest.zip` to Teams (in the left-bottom *Apps* view, click "Upload a custom app")
