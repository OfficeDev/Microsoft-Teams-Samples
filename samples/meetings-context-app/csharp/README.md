# Teams Meeting Context Sample C# 

This sample application illustrates how to display the contents of the meeting context object in a Microsoft Teams meeting tab. By using the bot's meeting APIs, it enables users to retrieve and interact with detailed information about meeting participants and the meeting itself, including start times, end times, and joining URLs, thus enhancing the collaborative experience within Teams.

## Included Features
* Bots
* Meeting Chat 
* Meeting Details
* RSC Permissions

## Try it yourself - experience the App in your Microsoft Teams client
Please find below demo manifest which is deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading the app manifest (.zip file link below) to your teams and/or as a personal app. (Sideloading must be enabled for your tenant, [see steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)).

**Teams Meeting Context Sample:** [Manifest](/samples/meetings-context-app/csharp/demo-manifest/meetings-context-app.zip)
 
## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account (not a guest account)
-  .[NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) SDK.
    ```bash
        # determine dotnet version
        dotnet --version
    ```
-  [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) latest version or equivalent tunneling solution
-  [M365 developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) or access to a Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app.
-  [Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)

## Run the app (Using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio.
1. Install Visual Studio 2022 **Version 17.10 Preview 4 or higher** [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
1. Install Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio [Teams Toolkit extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)
1. In the debug dropdown menu of Visual Studio, select Dev Tunnels > Create A Tunnel (set authentication type to Public) or select an existing public dev tunnel.
1. In the debug dropdown menu of Visual Studio, select default startup project > **Microsoft Teams (browser)**
1. In Visual Studio, right-click your **TeamsApp** project and **Select Teams Toolkit > Prepare Teams App Dependencies**
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps.
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the menu in Visual Studio.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.
> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (sideloading), Teams Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

## Setup 
> Note these instructions are for running the sample on your local machine.

1. Register a new application in the [Microsoft Entra ID – App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.

   - On the overview page, copy and save the **Application (client) ID, Directory (tenant) ID**. You’ll need those later when updating your Teams application manifest and in the appsettings.json.
-  Navigate to the **Certificates & secrets**. In the Client secrets section, click on "+ New client secret". Add a description (Name of the secret) for the secret and select “Never” for Expires. Click "Add". Once the client secret is created, copy its value, it need to be placed in the appsettings.json file

2. Setup for Bot
	- Register a Microsoft Entra ID aap registration in Azure portal.
	- Also, register a bot with Azure Bot Service, following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration?view=azure-bot-service-3.0).
	- Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
	- While registering the bot, use `https://<your_tunnel_domain>/api/messages` as the messaging endpoint.

    > NOTE: When you create your app registration, you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.
    
3. Setup NGROK
 - Run ngrok - point to port 3978

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

4. Setup for code

- Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

- Modify the `/appsettings.json` and fill in the following details:
  - `{{Microsoft-App-Id}}` - Generated from Step 1 while doing Microsoft Entra ID app registration in Azure portal.
  - `{{ Microsoft-App-Password}}` - Generated from Step 1, also referred to as Client secret
  - `{{ Microsoft-App-Tenant-Id }}` - Generated from Step 1, also referred to as Directory (tenant) ID

- Run the bot from a terminal or from Visual Studio:

  A) From a terminal, navigate to `samples/meetings-context-app/csharp`

  ```bash
  # run the bot
  dotnet run
  ```
  - Launch Visual Studio
   - File -> Open -> Project/Solution
   - Navigate to folder where repository is cloned then `samples/meetings-context-app/csharp/MeetingContextApp.sln`
    
5. Setup Manifest for Teams
- __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the ./appPackage folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your app registration earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `{{Microsoft-App-Id}}` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` and replace `{{domain-name}}` with base Url of your domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `appPackage` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)

- Upload the manifest.zip to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")
   - Go to Microsoft Teams. From the lower left corner, select Apps
   - From the lower left corner, choose Upload a custom App
   - Go to your project directory, the ./appPackage folder, select the zip folder, and choose Open.
   - Select Add in the pop-up dialog box. Your app is uploaded to Teams.
- Add the app in meeting.

 **NOTE:** Only accounts with admin access can create private/shared channels in team.
 - If you are facing any issue in your app,  please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/meetings-context-app/csharp/MeetingContextApp/AdapterWithErrorHandler.cs#L24) line and put your debugger for local debug.
    

## Running the sample

- Add the app in meeting.
- The details of the meeting context object will be shown on tab based.
![participant context](MeetingContextApp/Images/Setup-Tab-Bot.png)

- You can expand/reduce the JSON for the context object and can also copy a particular object slice.
- You can send one of these two commands: **Meeting Context** or **Participant Context**
- It will send you the output of `TeamsInfo.getMeetingInfo` and `TeamsInfo.getMeetingParticipant`

1. **Particpant Details :** User can see the details of current participant by the name id and other feilds respectively.

2. **Meeting Details :** In this user can track the detials of meeting start time, end time, joining url and other details respectively.
