## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account (not a guest account)
- To test locally, [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) must be installed on your development machine (version 16.14.2  or higher).
- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) latest version or equivalent tunneling solution.
- [M365 developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) or access to a Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app.
- [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com) access to set up service hooks and add custom field in workitem.
- [Teams Toolkit for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) or [TeamsFx CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/teamsfx-cli?pivots=version-one)

## Run the app (Using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code.

1. Ensure you have downloaded and installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)
1. Install the [Teams Toolkit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension)
1. Select **File > Open Folder** in VS Code and choose this samples directory from the repo
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the app in a Teams web client.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.

> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (sideloading), Teams Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

## Setup

> Note these instructions are for running the sample on your local machine, the tunnelling solution is required because
> the Teams service needs to call into the bot.

**Setup NGROK**
1) Run ngrok - point to port 3978

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

2) Once started you should see URL  `https://41ed-abcd-e125.ngrok-free.app`. Copy it, this is your baseUrl that will used as endpoint for Azure bot and webhook.


**Register Azure AD application**

Register one Azure AD application in your tenant's directory: for the bot and tab app authentication.

-  Log in to the Azure portal from your subscription, and go to the "App registrations" blade  [here](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps). Ensure that you use a tenant where admin consent for API permissions can be provided.

-  Click on "New registration", and create an Azure AD application.

-  **Name:**  The name of your Teams app - if you are following the template for a default deployment, we recommend "App catalog lifecycle".

-  **Supported account types:**  Select "Accounts in any organizational directory"

-  Leave the "Redirect URL" field blank.   

- Click on the "Register" button.

- When the app is registered, you'll be taken to the app's "Overview" page. Copy the  **Application (client) ID**; we will need it later. Verify that the "Supported account types" is set to  **Multiple organizations**.

-  On the side rail in the Manage section, navigate to the "Certificates & secrets" section. In the Client secrets section, click on "+ New client secret". Add a description for the secret and select Expires as "Never". Click "Add".

-  Once the client secret is created, copy its  **Value**, please take a note of the secret as it will be required later.


- At this point you have 3 unique values:
    -   Application (client) ID which will be later used during Azure bot creation
    -   Client secret for the bot which will be later used during Azure bot creation
    -   Directory (tenant) ID
We recommend that you copy these values into a text file, using an application like Notepad. We will need these values later.

-  Under left menu, navigate to  **API Permissions**, and make sure to add the following permissions of Microsoft Graph API > Application permissions:
    -  Chat.Create
    -  TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteForChat.All
    -  AppCatalog.Read.All
    -  User.Read.All
    -  Teamwork.Migrate.All

Click on Add Permissions to commit your changes.

- If you are logged in as the Global Administrator, click on the Grant admin consent for %tenant-name% button to grant admin consent else, inform your admin to do the same through the portal or follow the steps provided here to create a link and send it to your admin for consent.

- Global Administrator can grant consent using following link:  [https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/adminconsent?client_id=](https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/adminconsent?client_id=)<%appId%> 

**Setup for Bot**

- In Azure portal, create a [Azure Bot resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-authentication?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp%2Caadv2).

- Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)

- If you are using Ngrok to test locally, you'll need [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) installed on your development machine.
Make sure you've downloaded and installed Ngrok on your local machine. ngrok will tunnel requests from the Internet to your local computer and terminate the SSL connection from Teams.

**Setup Azure DevOps service hook**
- Follow this document- [Create Webhooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/service-hooks/services/webhooks?view=azure-devops) to service hook. 

- Make sure to select trigger as *Work item created*

- Make sure to add URL as https://{baseUrl}/api/workItem. It will look somethihng as https://41ed-abcd-e125.ngrok-free.app/api/workItem. *Here baseUrl is referred to URL we get in step 1*.
**NOTE: If you are not getting incoming request from Azure DevOps make sure that service webhook is in *Enabled* state.**

**Setup custom work item type**

- Follow the doc to [Add a custom field to an inherited process - Azure DevOps Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/settings/work/add-custom-field?view=azure-devops)

- Make sure to give name as *StakeholderTeam* and Type *Text (Single line)*

![Custom field](Images/CustomField.PNG)
- Make sure to [Apply the customized process to your project](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/settings/work/add-custom-field?view=azure-devops#apply-the-customized-process-to-your-project)

- Go to *Options* and check *Required* and Add.

**NOTE:Make sure you create a new task, click save and verify the stakeholderTeam value**
![Execute Webhook](Images/ExecuteWebhook.png)

**Setup for code**

1) Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

2) In the folder where repository is cloned navigate to `samples/release-management/nodejs`

3) Install node modules

   Inside node js folder, open your local terminal and run the below command to install node modules. You can do the same in Visual studio code terminal by opening the project in Visual studio code 

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4) Update the `.env` configuration for the bot to use the `MicrosoftAppId` and `MicrosoftAppPassword` and `MicrosoftAppTenantId` (Note that the MicrosoftAppId is the AppId created in step 4 , the MicrosoftAppPassword is referred to as the "client secret" in previous steps and you can always create a new client secret anytime., MicrosoftAppTenantId is reffered to as Directory tenant Id in previous steps).

5) Run your bot at the command line:
    ```bash
   npm start
    ```
**Setup Manifest for Teams**

- **This step is specific to Teams.**
- Edit the `manifest.json` contained in the  `/appManifest` folder to and fill in MicrosoftAppId (that was created in step 1 and it is the same value of MicrosoftAppId as in `.env` file) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<Microsoft-App-Id>>` (depending on the scenario it may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
- **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` with base Url domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.
- Zip up the contents of the `/appManifest` folder to create a `manifest.zip`
- Upload the manifest.zip to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload an app to your org's app catalog")

**Note**: If you are facing any issue in your app, please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/bot-release-management/nodejs/index.js#L52) line and put your debugger for local debug.

**Interacting with the bot**
- Login into [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com) and open the project where custom process was applied.
- Create a new workitem -> Tasks, provide comma seprated email ids in *StakeHolderTeam* (NOTE: The email should belong to tenant where we register Application in step 4)
- Save
- Bot will create the group chat with members you added and send the Task details.
