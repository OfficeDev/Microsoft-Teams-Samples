# Meetings AI Insights Bot

This sample demonstrates how to use the Microsoft Graph API to retrieve AI insights generated by Copilot for recorded meetings. To use this sample, you'll need:
- A user ID with an active Copilot license, fill it in .env file
- A meeting join URL for the meeting you want to analyze, fill it in .env file
- The user must be either an organizer or attendee of the meeting

After installing the app in Microsoft Teams, send any message to begin the authentication process. You'll see a permission consent popup - click **Continue** to proceed with sign-in. Use the same account whose user ID you specified in the .env file. After authentication, you'll need to grant permission to access meeting resources.

Once authenticated, the bot will retrieve the AI insights for your specified meeting.

> IMPORTANT: The **OnlineMeetingAiInsight.Read.All** permission requires administrator consent. Ensure your administrator has approved this permission.

> IMPORTANT: The manifest file includes "token.botframework.com" in the `validDomains` list, which is required for any bot using the Bot Framework OAuth flow.

## Try it yourself - experience the App in your Microsoft Teams client
Please find below demo manifest which is deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading the app package (.zip file link below) to your teams as a personal app. (Uploading must be enabled for your tenant, [see steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)).

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account (not a guest account)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
   ```bash
    # determine node version
    node --version
    ```
- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) latest version or equivalent tunnelling solution
- [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) or [TeamsFx CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/teamsfx-cli?pivots=version-one)

## Run the app (Using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio Code)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio Code.

1. Ensure you have downloaded and installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)
1. Install the [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension)
1. Select **File > Open Folder** in VS Code and choose this samples directory from the repo
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the app in a Teams web client.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.

> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (uploading), Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

## Setup

> Note these instructions are for running the sample on your local machine, the tunnelling solution is required because
> the Teams service needs to call into the bot.

### Setup for Bot Auth
Refer to [Bot SSO Setup document](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/bot-conversation-sso-quickstart/BotSSOSetup.md).

1. Setup NGROK
 - Run ngrok - point to port 3978

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

2. Setup for code

   - Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```
  - In a terminal, navigate to `samples\bot-meeting-ai-insights\nodejs` folder

  - Install modules
    
     ```bash
    npm install
    ```
  - Modify the `.env` file in your project folder (or in Visual Studio Code) and fill in below details:
       1) `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-TYPE>>` (**Allowed values are: MultiTenant(default), SingleTenant, UserAssignedMSI**)
       2) `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID>>` - Generated from Step 1 (Application (client) ID)is the application app id
       3) `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-PASSWORD>>` - Generated from Step 6, also referred to as Client secret
       4) `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-TENANT-ID>>` - Generated from Step 1(Directory (tenant) ID) is the tenant id
       5) `<<YOUR-CONNECTION-NAME>>` - Generated from step 7.
       6) `<<userId>>` - UserId of the with copilot licence and should be part of the meeting
       7) `<<meetingJoinUrl>>` - Join url of the meeting

  - Run your app

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
3) __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the `appManifest` folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your bot earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID>>` (depending on the scenario the MicrosoftAppId may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `{{domain-name}}` with base Url domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `appManifest` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)
    - **Upload** the `manifest.zip` to Teams (In Teams Apps/Manage your apps click "Upload an app". Browse to and Open the .zip file. At the next dialog, click the Add button.)
    - Add the app to personal scope or 1:1 chat (Supported scope)

**Note:**
-   If you are facing any issue in your app,  [please uncomment this line](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/bot-meeting-ai-insights/nodejs/index.js#L52) and put your debugger for local debug.
