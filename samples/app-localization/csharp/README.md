# Teams App Localization
A comprehensive sample that illustrates how to implement localization for Microsoft Teams apps using Bots and Tabs. This sample covers app registration, setup, and configuration to enable language-specific content in Microsoft Teams, Outlook, and Office on the web. Supports multiple languages, such as en-US, fr-CA, hi-IN, and es-MX, and includes integration with Microsoft Entra ID and Azure Bot Service.

This sample illustrates how to implement [Localization for Microsoft Teams apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/apps-localization).

## Included Features
* Bots
* Tabs
* Localization

## Interaction with app

![Preview Image](Images/Preview.gif)

## Try it yourself - experience the App in your Microsoft Teams client
Please find below demo manifest which is deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading the app package (.zip file link below) to your teams and/or as a personal app. (Sideloading must be enabled for your tenant; [see steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading).).

**App Localization:** [Manifest](/samples/app-localization/csharp/demo-manifest/app-localization.zip)

## Prerequisites

Verify you have the right account for building Teams apps and install some recommended development tools.

- You need a Teams account that allows [custom app sideloading](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/build-your-first-app/build-first-app-overview#set-up-your-development-account).
- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 6.0
- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) latest version or equivalent tunnelling solution

## Run the app (Using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio.
1. Install Visual Studio 2022 **Version 17.10 Preview 4 or higher** [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
1. Install Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio [Teams Toolkit extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)
1. In the debug dropdown menu of Visual Studio, select Dev Tunnels > Create A Tunnel (set authentication type to Public) or select an existing public dev tunnel.
1. In the debug dropdown menu of Visual Studio, select default startup project > **Microsoft Teams (browser)**
1. In Visual Studio, right-click your **TeamsApp** project and **Select Teams Toolkit > Prepare Teams App Dependencies**
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps.
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the menu in Visual Studio.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.
> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (sideloading), Teams Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

## Setup
1. Register a new application in the [Microsoft Entra ID â€“ App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.
    > NOTE: When you create your app registration, you will create an App ID and App password (Secret) - make sure you keep these for later.

2. Setup for Bot
	
	- Also, register a bot with Azure Bot Service, following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration?view=azure-bot-service-3.0)
	- Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
	- While registering the bot, use `https://<your_tunnel_domain>/api/messages` as the messaging endpoint.

3. Setup NGROK
 - Run ngrok - point to port 3978

    ```bash
    ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
    ```

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

4. Setup for code

  - Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```
  - Modify the `/appsettings.json` and fill in the following details:
  - `{{MicrosoftAppId}}` - Generated from Step 1 while doing Microsoft Entra ID app registration in Azure portal.
  - `{{ClientSecret}}` - Generated from Step 1, also referred to as Client secret

- Run the bot from a terminal or from Visual Studio:

5. If you are using Visual Studio
  - Launch Visual Studio
  - File -> Open -> Project/Solution
  - Navigate to `app-localization\csharp` folder
  - Select `Localization.csproj` file

6. This step is related to Microsoft Teams app manifest
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the `appPackage` or `AppManifest_Hub` folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your bot earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID>>` and <<Azure Bot ID>> and for the contentUrl "<<Tunnel Url>>?culture={locale}" (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
   - **Provide turnnelling Url** in `manifest.json` for contentUrl in case of tabs and for messaging endpoint in case of bots if enabled
   - replace `{{domain-name}}` with base Url of your domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `Manifest` or `Manifest_hub` folder to create a `manifest.zip`
    - **Upload** the `manifest.zip` to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")

**Note:** If you want to test your app across multi hub like: Outlook/Office.com, please update the `manifest.json` in the `/AppManifest_Hub` folder with the required values.

**Note**: If you are facing any issue in your app, please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/app-localization/csharp/Localization/AdapterWithErrorHandler.cs#L24) line and put your debugger for local debug.

# Running the sample

In Teams, Once the app is successfully installed, you can interact with tab and bot in your preferred language.

#### To change language in Teams
To change the language in Microsoft Teams, please click your profile picture at the top of the app, then select Settings -> General and go to the Language section. Choose the preferred language and restart to apply the change. This sample supports en-US, fr-CA, hi-IN and es-MX.
1. **Installation**: You should see your app installation screen content in selected language.

#### To Add more languages for localization in Teams through Code.
 
 Add Resource files for the respective languages, Check culture fallback behaviour and how to add other cultures refer [Globalization and localization Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/localization?view=aspnetcore-5.0).
