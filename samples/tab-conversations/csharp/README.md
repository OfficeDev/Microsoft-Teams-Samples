## Try it yourself - experience the App in your Microsoft Teams client
Please find below demo manifest which is deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading the app manifest (.zip file link below) to your teams and/or as a personal app. (Uploading must be enabled for your tenant, [see steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)).

**Conversational Tabs:** [Manifest](/samples/tab-conversations/csharp/demo-manifest/tab-conversations.zip)

## Prerequisites

- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 6.0

  ```bash
  # determine dotnet version
  dotnet --version
  ```
- [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)

## Run the app (Using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio.
1. Install Visual Studio 2022 **Version 17.14 or higher** [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
1. Install Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)
1. In the debug dropdown menu of Visual Studio, select default startup project > **Microsoft Teams (browser)**
1. Right-click the 'M365Agent' project in Solution Explorer and select **Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit > Select Microsoft 365 Account**
1. Sign in to Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit with a **Microsoft 365 work or school account**
1. Set `Startup Item` as `Microsoft Teams (browser)`.
1. Press F5, or select Debug > Start Debugging menu in Visual Studio to start your app

1. In the opened web browser, select Add button to install the app in Teams

> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (uploading), Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

## Setup
1. Register a new application in the [Microsoft Entra ID â€“ App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.

> NOTE: When you create your app registration, you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.

2. Setup NGROK
 - Run ngrok - point to port 3978

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

3. Setup for code

- Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```
- Run the bot from a terminal or from Visual Studio:

  A) From a terminal, navigate to `samples/tab-conversations/csharp`

  ```bash
  # run the bot
  dotnet run
  ```
  B) Or from Visual Studio
     - Launch Visual Studio
     - File -> Open -> Project/Solution
     - Navigate to `tab-conversations` folder
     - Select `TabConversation.csproj` file
     - Press `F5` to run the project

4. Setup Manifest for Teams
- __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the ./appPackage folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your app registration earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `{{Microsoft-App-Id}}` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` and replace `${{TAB_DOMAIN}}` with base Url of your domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `appPackage` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)

- Upload the manifest.zip to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")
   - Go to Microsoft Teams. From the lower left corner, select Apps
   - From the lower left corner, choose Upload a custom App
   - Go to your project directory, the ./appPackage folder, select the zip folder, and choose Open.
   - Select Add in the pop-up dialog box. Your app is uploaded to Teams.
