# Chat With Your Data
[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=322043759&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fmsteams-chat-with-your-data%2Fdevcontainer.json&resume=1)

This sample showcases Chat With Your Data is a powerful Teams app template designed to facilitate dynamic interactions with various data sources through an intuitive conversational interface. Utilizing Azure OpenAI's language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technology, users can seamlessly connect to data stored in Azure AI Search, Azure Blob Storage, and more, allowing for insightful and context-rich exchanges that enhance decision-making and data accessibility within Microsoft Teams.

- The user can set up a datasource such as Azure AI Search, Azure Blob Storage, URL/web address, Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore, uploaded files, or Elasticsearch.
- The user can then interact with the data through the Teams app template.

## Included Features
* **Azure Open AI:** Azure OpenAI On Your Data leverages OpenAI's language models, like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, augmented with RAG to provide a conversational interface for interacting with your domain data using the chat completions API.
* **Azure AI Search:** Azure AI  Search is utilized as a data source for Azure OpenAI's chat completions API.
* **Azure Blob Storage:** The uploaded files are stored in a container in Azure Blob Storage and indexed by Azure AI Search.

6. [Set up your data source using Azure AI resources](#set-up-your-data-source).
7. [Populate the environment files](#populate-the-environment-files).
8. Press **Ctrl+Shift+D** to open the ```Run and Debug``` menu. Press ```F5``` or click on the play button.
9. You can now [run the sample](#run-the-sample).

>[!Note]
> Check the status of all your local(Debug/F5 flow) bots on [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/bots).
> Check the status of all your Teams apps on [Teams Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/apps).
> Teams toolkit will also generate an app registration along with a password which can be seen under **App Registrations** on the Azure portal.

## Set up your data source
1. Run```sh deploy.sh``` in the terminal. You can use Azure Cloud Shell (Bash) for a Windows device. You will be prompted to login to Azure and select a subscription.
2. Go to the [Azure AI Studio](https://oai.azure.com/portal), select relevant subscription and the resource ```teamsazureopenai-cognitive```.
3.  Proceed to the ```Chat Playground```.  Click on ```Add a data source``` under the ```Add your data``` tab.
4. Upload your data with ```Upload files``` or ```URL/ web address```. Ensure you have the correct subscription selected. Select```teamsazureopenai``` as your storage resource and ```teamsazureopanai-search``` as your search resource. Type the index name you want to use.
5. Add your data and select search type and chunk size. Select ```API Key``` as the authentication type. Save and Close and wait for the data to be ingested.

## Populate the environment files
1. You need to populate the environment variables in ```env/.env.local.user``` if you are using the ```Debug``` or ```F5``` flow. Else, populate the environment variables in ```env/.env.dev.user``` if you are deploying the app on Azure.
2. Go to the the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/) and navigate to the resource group ```ChatWithYourData```. 
3. To populate ```SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_KEY, SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT``` variables:
   - Go to the ```teamsazureopenai-cognitive``` resource. Select the ```Keys and Endpoints``` tab under ```Resource Management```. Use ```Key 1``` and ```Endpoint```. 
4. To populate   ```SECRET_AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT``` variable:
   - Go to the ```teamsazureopenai-search``` resource. Use the ```Url``` given.
5. To populate   ```SECRET_AZURE_SEARCH_KEY``` variable:
   - Go to the ```teamsazureopenai-search``` resource. Select the ```Keys``` tab under ```Settings```.  Use ```Primary admin key```.
6. Populate ```AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX``` based on the index name you chose while setting up the data source.

## Sideload the app to Teams
1. Go to your Teams app and click on the ```Apps``` icon. Select ```Manage your apps``` followed by ```Upload an app```.
2. Select ```Upload a custom app``` and open the relevant zip file. Click on ```Add``` when prompted.

> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (sideloading), Teams Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

## Run the sample app
1. The bot sends a welcome message.
 ![welcome-message](images/welcome.png)
2. Chat with the bot.
 ![chat-with-the-bot](images/chat.png)
3. Clear the chat history.

Instead of the ```Debug``` or ```F5``` flow, you can deploy the app on Azure:
1. [Populate the environment files](#populate-the-environment-files).
2. Using the Teams Toolkit Extension tab, click on ```Provision``` followed by ```DEPLOY``` under ```LIFECYCLE```. You will be asked to select the subscription and resource group for provisioning.
3. Download the zip file ```appPackage/build/appPackage.dev.zip``` and [sideload the app to Teams](#sideload-the-app-to-teams).

>[!Note]
> Check the status of your dev(hosted on Azure) bots on [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home) by navigating to the relevant resource group.
> Check the status of all your Teams apps on [Teams Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/apps).
> Teams toolkit will also generate an app registration along with a password which can be seen under **App Registrations** on the Azure portal.
