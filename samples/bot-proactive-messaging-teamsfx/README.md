# How to use this Proactive message bots app

A bot, chatbot, or conversational bot is an app that responds to simple commands sent in chat and replies in meaningful ways. Examples of bots in everyday use include: bots that notify about build failures, bots that provide information about the weather or bus schedules, or provide travel information. A bot interaction can be a quick question and answer, or it can be a complex conversation. Being a cloud application, a bot can provide valuable and secure access to cloud services and corporate resources.

This is a sample which shows how to save user's conversation reference information to send proactive reminder message using Bots.

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- An M365 account. If you do not have M365 account, apply one from [M365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program)
- [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version after 1.55 or [Teams Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit-cli)

## Debug

- From Visual Studio Code: Start debugging the project by hitting the `F5` key in Visual Studio Code. 
- Alternatively use the `Run and Debug Activity Panel` in Visual Studio Code and click the `Run and Debug` green arrow button.
- From Teams Toolkit CLI:
  - Install [dev tunnel cli](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-install-dev-tunnel).
  - Login with your M365 Account using the command `devtunnel user login`.
  - Start your local tunnel service by running the command `devtunnel host -p 3978 --protocol http --allow-anonymous`.
  - In the `env/.env.local` file, fill in the values for `PROVISIONOUTPUT__BOTOUTPUT__VALIDDOMAIN` and `PROVISIONOUTPUT__BOTOUTPUT__SITEENDPOINT` with your dev tunnel URL.
    ```
    PROVISIONOUTPUT__BOTOUTPUT__VALIDDOMAIN=sample-id-3978.devtunnels.ms
    PROVISIONOUTPUT__BOTOUTPUT__SITEENDPOINT=https://sample-id-3978.devtunnels.ms
    ```
  - Executing the command `teamsapp provision --env local` in your project directory.
  - Executing the command `teamsapp deploy --env local` in your project directory.
  - Executing the command `teamsapp preview --env local --run-command "cd bot; npm run dev:teamsapp"` in your project directory.

**Note**: If deploying or provisioning the sample, please replace line 9 of file `bot/teamsBot.js` with .env.dev. (By default its set to `.env.local`)

## Edit the manifest

You can find the Teams app manifest in `templates/appPackage` folder. The folder contains a manifest template file:
* `manifest.template.json`

Both files contain template arguments with `{...}` statements which will be replaced at build time. You can hover the prepoerties to see the actual value or preview the manifest. You may add any extra properties or permissions you require to this file. See the [schema reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema) for more information.

**Note**: If you are facing any issue in your app, please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/bot-proactive-messaging-teamsfx/bot/index.js#L28) line and put your debugger for local debug.

> Important Notes! This sample is under upgrading, please expect errors if you attempted to provision and deploy the app to cloud.
> Once the sample complete upgrading, this notice will be removed. And the sample will be ready to be deployed to cloud by then.
> Before that, please debug and run this sample app locally!
