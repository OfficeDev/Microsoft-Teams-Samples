# Bot request approval
This sample demonstrates a Teams bot that facilitates task approval requests within group chats. Users can submit requests via Adaptive Cards, which managers can then approve or reject directly in the chat. Other group members can view request details, while only requesters and managers have access to actionable options. The sample supports Azure and includes comprehensive setup guidance, leveraging .NET Core and the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio.

## Included Features
* Bots
* Adaptive Cards

## Interaction with app

## Try it yourself - experience the App in your Microsoft Teams client
Please find below demo manifest which is deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading the app package (.zip file link below) to your teams and/or as a personal app. (Uploading must be enabled for your tenant, [see steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)).

**Bot request approval:** [Manifest](/samples/bot-request-approval/csharp/demo-manifest/Bot-Request-Approval.zip)

# Send task request using Universal Adaptive Cards in group chat

This sample shows a feature where:
1. **Requester :** Can request for any task approval from manager by initiating a request in group chat using bot command `request` and only requester can edit the request card.
2. **Manager :** Can see the request raised by user in the same group chat with an option of approve or reject.
3. **Others:** Other members in the group chat can see the request details only.


## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) latest version or equivalent tunnelling solution
- [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) or [TeamsFx CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/teamsfx-cli?pivots=version-one)

## Run the app (Using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio Code)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio Code.

1. Ensure you have downloaded and installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)
1. Install the [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension)
1. Select **File > Open Folder** in VS Code and choose this samples directory from the repo
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the app in a Teams web client.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.

> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (uploading), Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

## Setup
    
1. Register a new application in the [Microsoft Entra ID – App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.

2. Setup for Bot
	- Register a Microsoft Entra ID aap registration in Azure portal.
	- Also, register a bot with Azure Bot Service, following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration?view=azure-bot-service-3.0).
	- Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
	- While registering the bot, use `https://<your_tunnel_domain>/api/messages` as the messaging endpoint.

    > NOTE: When you create your app registration, you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.

3. Setup NGROK
 - Run ngrok - point to port 3978

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

4. Register a new application in the [Microsoft Entra ID – App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.
  
  A) Select **New Registration** and on the *register an application page*, set following values:
      * Set **name** to your app name.
      * Choose the **supported account types** (any account type will work)
      * Leave **Redirect URI** empty.
      * Choose **Register**.
  B) On the overview page, copy and save the **Application (client) ID, Directory (tenant) ID**. You'll need those later when updating your Teams application manifest and in the appsettings.json.
  C) Navigate to **API Permissions**, and make sure to add the following permissions:
   Select Add a permission
      * Select Add a permission
      * Select Microsoft Graph -\> Delegated permissions.
      * `User.Read` (enabled by default)
      * Click on Add permissions. Please make sure to grant the admin consent for the required permissions.


5. Setup for code

  - Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```
    - Open the `.env` configuration file in your project folder (or in Visual Studio Code) and update the `ClientId` and `ClientSecret`, `BaseURL` with your app's base url. (Note the ClientId is the AppId created in step 1 (Setup for Bot), the ClientSecret is referred to as the "client secret" in step 1 (Setup for Bot) and you can always create a new client secret anytime.)
    
  - In the folder where repository is cloned navigate to `samples/bot-request-approval/nodejs`

  - Install node modules

   Inside node js folder, open your local terminal and run the below command to install node modules. You can do the same in Visual Studio code terminal by opening the project in Visual Studio code.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```  

 - Run your app

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
6. Setup Manifest for Teams
- __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the ./appManifest folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your app registration earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `{{Microsoft-App-Id}}` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` and replace `{{domain-name}}` with base Url of your domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `appManifest` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)

- Upload the manifest.zip to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")
   - Go to Microsoft Teams. From the lower left corner, select Apps
   - From the lower left corner, choose Upload a custom App
   - Go to your project directory, the ./appManifest folder, select the zip folder, and choose Open.
   - Select Add in the pop-up dialog box. Your app is uploaded to Teams.

**Note**: If you are facing any issue in your app, please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/bot-request-approval/nodejs/index.js#L47) line and put your debugger for local debug.
