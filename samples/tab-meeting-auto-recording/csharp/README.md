## Prerequisites

- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 6.0

  determine dotnet version
  ```bash
  dotnet --version
  ```
- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) latest version or equivalent tunnelling solution.
- [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com) Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account
- [Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)

## Run the app (Using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio.
1. Install Visual Studio 2022 **Version 17.10 Preview 4  or higher** [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
1. Install Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio [Teams Toolkit extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)
1. In the debug dropdown menu of Visual Studio, select default startup project > **Microsoft Teams (browser)**
1. In Visual Studio, right-click your **TeamsApp** project and **Select Teams Toolkit > Prepare Teams App Dependencies**
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps.
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the menu in Visual Studio.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.
> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (sideloading), Teams Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

## Manually Setup and use the sample locally

### Setup Register you app with Azure AD.

  1. Register a new application in the [Microsoft Entra ID – App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.
  2. Select **New Registration** and on the *register an application page*, set following values:
      * Set **name** to your app name.
      * Choose the **supported account types** (any account type will work)
      * Leave **Redirect URI** empty.
      * Choose **Register**.
  3. On the overview page, copy and save the **Application (client) ID, Directory (tenant) ID**. You’ll need those later when updating your Teams application manifest and in the appsettings.json.
  4. Under **Manage**, select **Expose an API**. 
  5. Select the **Set** link to generate the Application ID URI in the form of `api://{base-url}/{AppID}`. Insert your fully qualified domain name (with a forward slash "/" appended to the end) between the double forward slashes and the GUID. The entire ID should have the form of: `api://fully-qualified-domain-name/{AppID}`
      * ex: `api://%ngrokDomain%.ngrok-free.app/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`.
  6. Select the **Add a scope** button. In the panel that opens, enter `access_as_user` as the **Scope name**.
  7. Set **Who can consent?** to `Admins and users`
  8. Fill in the fields for configuring the admin and user consent prompts with values that are appropriate for the `access_as_user` scope:
      * **Admin consent title:** Teams can access the user’s profile.
      * **Admin consent description**: Allows Teams to call the app’s web APIs as the current user.
      * **User consent title**: Teams can access the user profile and make requests on the user's behalf.
      * **User consent description:** Enable Teams to call this app’s APIs with the same rights as the user.
  9. Ensure that **State** is set to **Enabled**
  10. Select **Add scope**
      * The domain part of the **Scope name** displayed just below the text field should automatically match the **Application ID** URI set in the previous step, with `/access_as_user` appended to the end:
          * `api://[ngrokDomain].ngrok-free.app/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/access_as_user.
  11. In the **Authorized client applications** section, identify the applications that you want to authorize for your app’s web application. Each of the following IDs needs to be entered:
      * `1fec8e78-bce4-4aaf-ab1b-5451cc387264` (Teams mobile/desktop application)
      * `5e3ce6c0-2b1f-4285-8d4b-75ee78787346` (Teams web application)
      * `4765445b-32c6-49b0-83e6-1d93765276ca` (Microsoft 365 web application)
      * `0ec893e0-5785-4de6-99da-4ed124e5296c` (Microsoft 365 desktop application)
      * `d3590ed6-52b3-4102-aeff-aad2292ab01c` (Outlook desktop application)
      * `bc59ab01-8403-45c6-8796-ac3ef710b3e3` (Outlook web application)
      * `27922004-5251-4030-b22d-91ecd9a37ea4` (Outlook mobile application)
  12. Navigate to **API Permissions**, and make sure to add the follow permissions:
  -   Select Add a permission
  -   Select Microsoft Graph -\> Delegated permissions.
  -   Select Microsoft Graph -\> Application permissions.

      ![Login-In ](MeetingAutoRecording/Images/Permissions.png)

  -   Click on Add permissions. Please make sure to grant the admin consent for the required permissions.
  13. Navigate to **Authentication**
      If an app hasn't been granted IT admin consent, users will have to provide consent the first time they use an app.
  - Set a redirect URI:
      * Select **Add a platform**.
      * Select **Single-page application**.
      * Enter the **redirect URI** for the app in the following format: `https://{Base_Url}/auth-end` and `https://{Base_Url}/auth-start`.
  14.  Navigate to the **Certificates & secrets**. In the Client secrets section, click on "+ New client secret". Add a description(Name of the secret) for the secret and select “Never” for Expires. Click "Add". Once the client secret is created, copy its value, it need to be placed in the appsettings.json.
  15.  Create a policy for a demo tenant user for creating the online meeting on behalf of that user using the following PowerShell script
  -  Follow this link- [Configure application access policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/cloud-communication-online-meeting-application-access-policy)

      ![Policy ](MeetingAutoRecording/Images/Policy.png)

## Setup 

> Note these instructions are for running the sample on your local machine.

1. Run ngrok - point to port 2544

   ```bash
   ngrok http https://localhost:2544
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 2544 --allow-anonymous
   ```

2. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```
    
3. Run the app from a terminal or from Visual Studio, choose option A or B.

    A) From a terminal, navigate to `samples/tab-meeting-auto-recording/csharp`

    ```bash
    # run the app
    dotnet run
    ```
    B) Or from Visual Studio

    - Launch Visual Studio
    - File -> Open -> Project/Solution
    - Navigate to `samples/tab-meeting-auto-recording/csharp` folder
    - Select `MeetingAutoRecording.sln` file
    - Press `F5` to run the project
    
**Note:** In the debug dropdown menu of Visual Studio, select default startup project > **MeetingAutoRecording**

4. In a terminal, navigate to `samples/tab-meeting-auto-recording/csharp/MeetingAutoRecording/ClientApp`

    - Inside ClientApp folder execute the below command.

        ```bash
        # npm install
        # npm start

        ```
5. Open .env file from this path folder `samples/tab-meeting-auto-recording/csharp/MeetingAutoRecording/ClientApp` and update:
   - `{{MicrosoftAppId}}` - Generated from Step 1 (Application (client) ID)is the application app id
   
6. Modify the `/appsettings.json` and fill in the following details:
   - `{{MicrosoftAppId}}` - Generated from Step 1 (Application (client) ID)is the application app id
   - `{{MicrosoftAppPassword}}` - Generated from Step 1.14, also referred to as Client secret
   - `{{TenantId}}` - Generated from Step 1(Directory (tenant) ID) is the tenant id
   - `{{BaseUrlNgrok}}` - With base Url domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be 1234.ngrok-free.app and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be 12345.devtunnels.ms.
   > Make sure to manually update `{{BaseUrlNgrok}}` with the ngrok or dev-tunnel URL. Otherwise, notifications will not function correctly.

**This step is specific to Teams:**

- **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the  `TeamsApp/AppPackage` folder to replace your Microsoft App Id `{{AAD_APP_CLIENT_ID}}` and  `{{TEAMS_APP_ID}}` (that was created when you registered your bot earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `{{AAD_APP_CLIENT_ID}}` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)

- **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `{{TAB_DOMAIN}}` with base Url domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.

- **Zip** up the contents of the `TeamsApp/AppPackage` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)

- **Upload** the `manifest.zip` to Teams (In Teams Apps/Manage your apps click "Upload an app". Browse to and Open the .zip file. At the next dialog, click the Add button.)

- Add the app to personal static tabs.
