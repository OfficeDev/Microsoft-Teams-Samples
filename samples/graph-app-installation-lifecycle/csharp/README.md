# App Installation

This sample app demonstrates the installation lifecycle for Teams [Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/teamsappinstallation?view=graph-rest-1.0), showcasing how to create, update, and delete apps using Microsoft Graph APIs via a Teams tab. It features interactive elements, such as tabs, and provides a guided setup for seamless integration within Microsoft Teams, offering developers a comprehensive experience in app lifecycle management.

## Included Features
* Tabs
* Graph API

## Interaction with app

## Try it yourself - experience the App in your Microsoft Teams client
Please find below demo manifest which is deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading the app manifest (.zip file link below) to your teams and/or as a personal app. (Uploading must be enabled for your tenant, [see steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)).

**App Installation:** [Manifest](/samples/graph-app-installation-lifecycle/csharp/demo-manifest/graph-app-installation-lifecycle.zip)

## Prerequisites

- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 6.0

  determine dotnet version
  ```bash
  dotnet --version
  ```
- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) (For local environment testing) latest version (any other tunneling software can also be used)
  
- [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com) Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account

- [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)

## Run the app (Using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio.
1. Install Visual Studio 2022 **Version 17.14 or higher** [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
1. Install Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)
1. In the debug dropdown menu of Visual Studio, select default startup project > **Microsoft Teams (browser)**
1. Right-click the 'M365Agent' project in Solution Explorer and select **Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit > Select Microsoft 365 Account**
1. Sign in to Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit with a **Microsoft 365 work or school account**
1. Set `Startup Item` as `Microsoft Teams (browser)`.
1. Press F5, or select Debug > Start Debugging menu in Visual Studio to start your app
    </br>![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/dev/docs/images/visualstudio/debug/debug-button.png)
1. In the opened web browser, select Add button to install the app in Teams
> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (uploading), Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

### Register your app with Azure AD.

  1. Register a new application in the [Microsoft Entra ID – App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.
  2. Select **New Registration** and on the *register an application page*, set following values:
      * Set **name** to your app name.
      * Choose the **supported account types** (any account type will work)
      * Leave **Redirect URI** empty.
      * Choose **Register**.
  3. On the overview page, copy and save the **Application (client) ID, Directory (tenant) ID**. You'll need those later when updating your Teams application manifest and in the appsettings.json.
  4. Navigate to **API Permissions**, and make sure to add the follow permissions:
   Select Add a permission
      * Select Add a permission
      * Select Microsoft Graph -\> Delegated permissions.
      * `User.Read` (enabled by default)
      * Click on Add permissions. Please make sure to grant the admin consent for the required permissions.


## Setup

1. Register a new application in the [Microsoft Entra ID – App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.

  - You need to add following permissions mentioned in the below screenshots to call respective Graph   API
    ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50989436/116188975-e155a300-a745-11eb-9ce5-7f467007e243.png)
    
2. Setup for Bot
  - Register a Microsoft Entra ID aap registration in Azure portal.
  - Also, register a bot with Azure Bot Service, following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration?view=azure-bot-service-3.0).
  - Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
  - While registering the bot, use `https://<your_tunnel_domain>/api/messages` as the messaging endpoint.

    > NOTE: When you create your app registration, you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.

3. Setup NGROK
 - Run ngrok - point to port 3978

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

4. Setup for code

- Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

- Modify the `/appsettings.json` and fill in the following details:
  - `{{Your Microsoft App Id}}` - Generated from Step 1 while doing Microsoft Entra ID app registration in Azure portal.
  - `{{ Your Microsoft App Password }}` - Generated from Step 1, also referred to as Client secret
  
  
 - Build your solution
   - Launch Visual Studio
   - File -> Open -> Project/Solution
   - Navigate to `samples/graph-app-installation-lifecycle/csharp/AppInstallation` folder
   - Select `AppInstallation.csproj` file
   - Press `F5` to run the project
5. Setup Manifest for Teams
- __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the ./appPackage folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your app registration earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `{{Microsoft-App-Id}}` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` and replace `{{domain-name}}` with base Url of your domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `appPackage` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)

- Upload the manifest.zip to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")
   - Go to Microsoft Teams. From the lower left corner, select Apps
   - From the lower left corner, choose Upload a custom App
   - Go to your project directory, the ./appPackage folder, select the zip folder, and choose Open.
   - Select Add in the pop-up dialog box. Your app is uploaded to Teams.

- [Upload app manifest file](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/deploy-and-publish/apps-upload#load-your-package-into-teams) (zip file) to your team

**Note**: If you are facing any issue in your app, please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/graph-appcatalog-lifecycle/nodejs/index.js#L45) line and put your debugger for local debug.
