# Bots/Messaging Extension

*Bots* allow users to interact with your web service through text, interactive cards, and task modules. *Messaging extensions* allow users to interact with your web service through buttons and forms in the Microsoft Teams client. They can search, or initiate actions, in an external system from the compose message area, the command box, or directly from a message.

## Included Features
* Bots
* Adaptive Cards
* Teams Conversation Events

## Prerequisites

**Dependencies**
-  [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-  [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) latest version or equivalent tunneling solution
-  [M365 developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) or access to a Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app.
- [Teams Toolkit for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) or [TeamsFx CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/teamsfx-cli?pivots=version-one)

## Run the app (Using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code.

1. Ensure you have downloaded and installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)
1. Install the [Teams Toolkit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension)
1. Select **File > Open Folder** in VS Code and choose this samples directory from the repo
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the app in a Teams web client.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.

> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (sideloading), Teams Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

## Run the app (Manually Uploading to Teams)

1. Register a new application in the [Microsoft Entra ID â€“ App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.
   
2. Setup for Bot
   In Azure portal, create a [Bot Framework registration resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-authentication?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp%2Caadv2).
   - Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
   - For the Messaging endpoint URL, use the current `https` URL you were given by running the tunneling application and append it with the path `/api/messages`. It should like something work `https://{subdomain}.ngrok-free.app/api/messages`. 

  **NOTE:** When you create your bot you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.

- Click on the `Bots` menu item from the toolkit and select the bot you are using for this project.  Update the messaging endpoint and press enter to save the value in the Bot Framework.

- Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)

3. Setup NGROK
 - Run ngrok - point to port 3978

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

4. Setup for code

  - Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    
   - In a terminal, navigate to `samples/bot-conversation-quickstart/js`
   
  -  Build
  
     `npm install`
     
   - Run your app 
    
      `npm start`

5. Update the `.env` configuration for the bot to use the `BotId` and `BotPassword` (Note the BotId is the AppId created in step 1 (Setup for Bot), the BotPassword is referred to as the "client secret" in step 1 (Setup for Bot) and you can always create a new client secret anytime.)


6. Setup Manifest for Teams

- **This step is specific to Teams.**
    - Edit the `manifest.json` contained in the `appManifest/` folder to replace with your MicrosoftAppId (that was created in step1.1 and is the same value of MicrosoftAppId in `.env` file) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `{MicrosoftAppId}` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - Zip up the contents of the `appManifest/` folder to create a `manifest.zip`
    - Upload the `manifest.zip` to Teams (in the left-bottom *Apps* view, click "Upload a custom app")

**Note**: If you are facing any issue in your app, please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/bot-conversation-quickstart/js/index.js#L43) line and put your debugger for local debug.
