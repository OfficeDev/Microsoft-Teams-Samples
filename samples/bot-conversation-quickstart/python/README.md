# Bot Conversation QuickStart (Python) 

This sample demonstrates how to build a bot for Microsoft Teams using the Bot Framework in Python. It highlights key features such as sending Hero Cards, handling user messages, and participating in Teams conversations.

Hero Card Integration: Teaches how to create and send Hero Cards with actionable buttons, allowing users to interact with predefined commands.

## Included Features
* Bots
* Hero Cards
* Teams Conversation Events

## Interaction with app

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account
- [Python SDK](https://www.python.org/downloads/) min version 3.6
- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) latest version or equivalent tunnelling solution
- [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) or [TeamsFx CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/teamsfx-cli?pivots=version-one)

## Run the app (Using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio Code)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio Code.

1. Ensure you have downloaded and installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)
1. Install the [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) and [Python Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
1. Select **File > Open Folder** in VS Code and choose this samples directory from the repo
1. Press **CTRL+Shift+P** to open the command box and enter **Python: Create Environment** to create and activate your desired virtual environment. Remember to select `requirements.txt` as dependencies to install when creating the virtual environment.
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the app in a Teams web client.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.

> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (uploading), Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

## Run the app (Manually Uploading to Teams)

1. Register a new application in the [Microsoft Entra ID – App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.
  A) Select **New Registration** and on the *register an application page*, set following values:
      * Set **name** to your app name.
      * Choose the **supported account types** (any account type will work)
      * Leave **Redirect URI** empty.
      * Choose **Register**.
  B) On the overview page, copy and save the **Application (client) ID, Directory (tenant) ID**. You'll need those later when updating your Teams application manifest and in the appsettings.json.
  C) Navigate to **API Permissions**, and make sure to add the following permissions:
   Select Add a permission
      * Select Add a permission
      * Select Microsoft Graph -\> Delegated permissions.
      * `User.Read` (enabled by default)
      * Click on Add permissions. Please make sure to grant the admin consent for the required permissions.
   
2. Setup for Bot
   In Azure portal, create a [Bot Framework registration resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-authentication?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp%2Caadv2).
   - Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
   - For the Messaging endpoint URL, use the current `https` URL you were given by running the tunneling application and append it with the path `/api/messages`. It should look something like `https://{subdomain}.ngrok-free.app/api/messages`. 

  **NOTE:** When you create your bot you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.

- Click on the `Bots` menu item from the toolkit and select the bot you are using for this project.  Update the messaging endpoint and press enter to save the value in the Bot Framework.

- Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)

3. Setup NGROK
 - Run ngrok - point to port 3978

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

4. Setup for code

  - Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    
   - In a terminal, navigate to `samples/bot-conversation-quickstart/python`
   
   - Activate your desired virtual environment

   - Install dependencies by running ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in the project folder.

5) Update the `config.py` configuration for the bot to use the Microsoft App Id and App Password from the Bot Framework registration. (Note the App Password is referred to as the "client secret" in the azure portal and you can always create a new client secret anytime.)

6) __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the `appManifest` folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your bot earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `${{AAD_APP_CLIENT_ID}}` and `${{TEAMS_APP_ID}}` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `appManifest` folder to create a `manifest.zip`
    - **Upload** the `manifest.zip` to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")

7) Run your bot with `python app.py`
