# Third-Party Storage Integration in Microsoft Teams
Microsoft Teams allows users to integrate third-party cloud storage providers by modifying the default storage options from OneDrive and SharePoint. This capability enables files that are dragged and dropped into the Teams chat or message compose area to be stored in a third-party storage service. Using the Microsoft Teams JavaScript client library (TeamsJS), third-party apps can capture these files through the getDragAndDropFiles API and then upload them to their own cloud storage.

To enable this feature, the latest version of the TeamsJS SDK is required, along with a properly configured app manifest and the app ID of the third-party storage provider. When a file is dragged and dropped, it is temporarily cached in Teams before being fetched by the third-party app and uploaded to its storage. This seamless integration enhances flexibility for businesses using external storage solutions within the Teams environment.

## Included Features

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account
- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 6.0
- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) latest version or equivalent tunnelling solution

## Run the app (Using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio.
1. Install Visual Studio 2022 **Version 17.10 Preview 4 or higher** [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
1. Install Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio [Teams Toolkit extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)
1. In the debug dropdown menu of Visual Studio, select Dev Tunnels > Create A Tunnel (set authentication type to Public) or select an existing public dev tunnel.
1. In the debug dropdown menu of Visual Studio, select default startup project > **Microsoft Teams (browser)**
1. In Visual Studio, right-click your **TeamsApp** project and **Select Teams Toolkit > Prepare Teams App Dependencies**
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps.
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the menu in Visual Studio.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.
> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (sideloading), Teams Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

## Setup

> Note these instructions are for running the sample on your local machine, the tunnelling solution is required because
the Teams service needs to call into the bot.

1) Run ngrok - point to port 3978

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

1) Setup for Bot

   In Azure portal, create a [Azure Bot resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration).
    - For bot handle, make up a name.
    - Select "Use existing app registration" (Create the app registration in Microsoft Entra ID beforehand.)
    - __*If you don't have an Azure account*__ create an [Azure free account here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
    
   In the new Azure Bot resource in the Portal, 
    - Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
    - In Settings/Configuration/Messaging endpoint, enter the current `https` URL you were given by running the tunnelling application. Append with the path `/api/messages`

1) Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

1) If you are using Visual Studio
   - Launch Visual Studio
   - File -> Open -> Project/Solution
   - Navigate to `samples/msgext-thirdparty-storage/csharp` folder
   - Select `TeamsMsgextThirdpartyStorage.csproj` or `TeamsMsgextThirdpartyStorage.sln`file

1) Update the `appsettings.json` configuration for the bot to use the MicrosoftAppId, MicrosoftAppPassword, MicrosoftAppTenantId generated in Step 1 (App Registration creation). (Note the App Password is referred to as the "client secret" in the azure portal and you can always create a new client secret anytime.)
   - Set "MicrosoftAppType" in the `appsettings.json`. (**Allowed values are: MultiTenant(default), SingleTenant, UserAssignedMSI**)

   - Set "BaseUrl" in the `appsettings.json` as per your application like the ngrok forwarding url (ie `https://xxxx.ngrok-free.app`) after starting ngrok and if you are using dev tunnels, your URL will be like: https://12345.devtunnels.ms.

1) Run your bot, either from Visual Studio with `F5` or using `dotnet run` in the appropriate folder.

1) __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the `appPackage` folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your bot earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID>>` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` with base Url domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `appPackage` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)
    - **Upload** the `manifest.zip` to Teams (In Teams Apps/Manage your apps click "Upload an app to your org's app catalog". Browse to and Open the .zip file. At the next dialog, click the Add button.)
    - Add the bot to personal/team/groupChat scope (Supported scopes)

**Note**: If you are facing any issue in your app, please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/msgext-thirdparty-storage/csharp/AdapterWithErrorHandler.cs#L25) line and put your debugger for local debug.
