# FAQ+ Bot
[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=322043759&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fmsteams-FAQPlus%2Fdevcontainer.json&resume=1)

This sample implements a chatbot that answers queries based on a custom database using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search and escalates queries to a Teams channel when asked. 
- The user can set up a datasource such as Azure AI Search, Azure Blob Storage, URL/web address, Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore, uploaded files, or Elasticsearch.
- The user can then interact with the data through the bot.
- The bot sends an adaptive card using proactive messaging to a Teams Channel if asked.
- Experts can then engage with users and update the knowledge base dynamically.

## Included Features
* **Azure Open AI:** Azure OpenAI On Your Data leverages OpenAI's language models, like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, augmented with RAG to provide a conversational interface for answering queries from your domain data using the chat completions API.
* **Azure AI Search:** Azure AI Search is utilized as a data source for Azure OpenAI's chat completions API.
* **Proactive Messaging:** Proactive messaging is used to send a message to the Teams channel by initiating a conversation.
* **Adaptive Cards:** Adaptive cards are used to send the conversation history to the Teams channel and allow for actions such as "chat with user" or "close ticket".

9. You can now [run the sample app](#run-the-sample-app).

>[!Note]
> Check the status of all your local(Debug/F5 flow) bots on [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/bots).
> Check the status of all your Teams apps on [Teams Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/apps).
> Teams toolkit will also generate an app registration along with a password which can be seen under **App Registrations** on the Azure portal.

## Set up your knowledge base
1. Run```sh deploy.sh``` in the terminal to deploy Azure Saerch and Azure OpenAI. You will be prompted to login to Azure and select a subscription.
2. Add all your files to the ```src/data``` folder and URLs to ```src/indexer/URL.txt``` and run ```python ./src/indexer/setup.py```.
3. To delete the exisiting index, run ```python .src/indexer/delete.py```.

## Populate the environment files
1. You need to populate the environment variables in ```env/.env.local.user``` if you are using the ```Debug``` or ```F5``` flow. Else, populate the environment variables in ```env/.env.dev.user``` if you are dpleoying the app on Azure.
2. Go to the the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/) and navigate to the resource group ```FaqBot```. 
3. To populate ```SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_KEY, SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT``` variables:
   - Go to the ```faqbot-cognitive``` resource. Select the ```Keys and Endpoints``` tab under ```Resource Management```. Use ```Key 1``` and ```Endpoint```. 
4. To populate   ```SECRET_AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT``` variable:
   - Go to the ```faqbot-search``` resource. Use the ```Url``` given.
5. To populate   ```SECRET_AZURE_SEARCH_KEY``` variable:
   - Go to the ```faqbot-search``` resource. Select the ```Keys``` tab under ```Settings```.  Use ```Primary admin key```.
6. Set the environment variable ```TEAMS_CHANNEL_ID``` from the link of the channel - https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/<teams_channel_id_string>/.  Remember to first decode the URL-encoded string.

## Sideload the app to Teams personal chat:
1. Go to your Teams app and click on the ```Apps``` icon. Select ```Manage your apps``` followed by ```Upload an app```.
2. Select ```Upload a custom app``` and open the relevant zip file. Click on ```Add``` when prompted.

## Sideload the app to Teams channel:
1. Go to the channel where you want to raise requests for help. Click on the ```Apps``` icon. Select ```Got more apps``` followed by ```Manage your apps```.
2. Click on ```Upload an app``` and open the relevant zip file.  Click on ```Add``` when prompted. Select the correct channel and click on ```Go```

> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (sideloading), Teams Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

## Run the sample app
1. The bot sends a welcome message.
 ![welcome-message](images/welcome.png)
2. User chats with the bot.
 ![chat-with-the-bot](images/chat.png)
3. User wants to talk to an expert.
 ![talk-to-an-expert](images/expert.png)
4. The query and brief conversation history is posted to the Teams channel.
 ![post-query-on-channel](images/channel.png)
5. Anyone on the Teams channel can assign the ticket to themselves.
 ![assign-ticket-to-me](images/assign.png)
6. Anyone on the Teams channel can chat with the user.
 ![chat-with-user](images/chat_with_user.png)
7. Anyone on the Teams channel can close the ticket.
 ![close-ticket](images/close.png)
8. User clears the chat history.

## How the knowledge base works
![FAQBot Setup](images/architecture.png)
1. **User Query**:
    - The user asks the bot a question.
2. **Prompt Generation**:
    - The bot generates a prompt based on the user's question.
3. **Azure AI Search**:
    - The prompt is sent as a query to Azure AI Search to find relevant information.
    - The top ranked search results are sent to the LLM.
4. **Azure OpenAI**:
   - The promt is also sent to Azure OpenAI model to set the context and intent.
   - The model provides a generative response which is sent back to the user.

## Deploy/Host the app on Azure
Instead of the ```Debug``` or ```F5``` flow, you can deploy the app on Azure:
1. [Populate the environment files](#populate-the-environment-files).
2. Using the Teams Toolkit Extension tab, click on ```Provision``` followed by ```DEPLOY``` under ```LIFECYCLE```. You will be asked to select the subscription and resource group for provisioning.
3. Using the zip file ```appPackage/build/appPackage.dev.zip```, [sideload the app to Teams personal chat](#sideload-the-app-to-teams-personal-chat) and [sideload the app to Teams Channel](#sideload-the-app-to-teams-channel)

>[!Note]
> Check the status of your dev(hosted on Azure) bots on [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home) by navigating to the relevant resource group.
> Check the status of all your Teams apps on [Teams Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/apps).
> Teams toolkit will also generate an app registration along with a password which can be seen under **App Registrations** on the Azure portal.
