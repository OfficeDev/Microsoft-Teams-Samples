# Install app using barcode sample

This C# sample illustrates the process of installing Microsoft Teams apps via QR code scanning. Users can generate a QR code containing the app ID, making installation straightforward while leveraging features such as bot interaction, Teams SSO, adaptive cards, task modules, and media permissions.

`Currently, Microsoft Teams support for QR or barcode scanner capability is only available for mobile clients`.

## Included Features
* Bot
* Teams SSO (bots)
* Adaptive Cards
* Task Modules
* Device Permissions (media)
* Graph API

## Interaction with bot - Desktop View

## Try it yourself - experience the App in your Microsoft Teams client
Please find below demo manifest which is deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading the app package (.zip file link below) to your teams and/or as a personal app. (Sideloading must be enabled for your tenant, [see steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)).

**Install app using barcode sample:** [Manifest](/samples/app-installation-using-qr-code/csharp/demo-manifest/App-Installation-Using-QR.zip)

## Prerequisites

- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 6.0

  determine dotnet version
  ```bash
  dotnet --version
  ```
- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) (For local environment testing) latest version (any other tunneling software can also be used)

- [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com) Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account

- [Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)

## Run the app (Using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio.
1. Install Visual Studio 2022 **Version 17.10 Preview 4 or higher** [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
1. Install Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio [Teams Toolkit extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)
1. In the debug dropdown menu of Visual Studio, select Dev Tunnels > Create A Tunnel (set authentication type to Public) or select an existing public dev tunnel.
1. In the debug dropdown menu of Visual Studio, select default startup project > **Microsoft Teams (browser)**
1. In Visual Studio, right-click your **TeamsApp** project and **Select Teams Toolkit > Prepare Teams App Dependencies**
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps.
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the menu in Visual Studio.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.
> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (sideloading), Teams Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

**Note:** Add the following manually under 'Azure API permissions':
- Delegated Permissions
  1. TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteAndConsentSelfForTeam
  2. TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteAndConsentForTeam

## Setup

1) Setup for Bot SSO
- Refer to [Bot SSO Setup document](../BotSSOSetup.md)

- Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)

- While registering the Azure bot, use `https://<your_tunnel_domain>/api/messages` as the messaging endpoint.
    
    > NOTE: When you create your app registration in Azure portal, you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.

2) Setup NGROK
-  Run ngrok - point to port 3978

    ```bash
    ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
    ```
   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

3) Setup for code
- Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
   ```
   
- In a terminal, navigate to `samples/app-installation-using-qr-code/csharp`

    change into project folder
    ```bash
    cd # QRAppInstallation
    ```
 
- Modify the `/appsettings.json` and fill in the following details:
  - `{{Microsoft-App-Id}}` - Generated from Step 1 from Microsoft Entra ID app registration in Azure portal
  - `{{Microsoft-App-Password}}` - Generated from Step 1, also referred to as Client secret
  - `{{ Application Base Url }}` - Your application's base url. E.g. https://12345.ngrok-free.app if you are using ngrok and if you are using dev tunnels, your URL will be https://12345.devtunnels.ms.
  - `{{ Auth Connection Name }}` - The OAuthConnection setting from step 1, from Azure Bot SSO setup

The `Connection Name` referred to is the name that we provide while adding OAuth connection setting in the Bot channel registration.
Please follow link [Add authentication to your bot](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/authentication/add-authentication?tabs=dotnet%2Cdotnet-sample#azure-ad-v2) to see how we can add the setting.
 
- Run the bot from a terminal or from Visual Studio, choose option A or B.
 
   A) From a terminal
     ```bash
     # run the bot
     dotnet run
     ```

   B) Or from Visual Studio
     - Launch Visual Studio
     - File -> Open -> Project/Solution
     - Navigate to `QRAppInstallation` folder
     - Select `QRAppInstallation.csproj` file
     - Press `F5` to run the project 

- Modify the `manifest.json` in the `/AppManifest` folder and replace the following details:
  - `{{Microsoft-App-Id}}` with Microsoft Entra ID app registration Application id, generated from Step 1
  - `{{domain-name}}` with base Url domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.

- Zip the contents of `AppManifest` folder into a `manifest.zip`, and use the `manifest.zip` to deploy in app store or add to Teams.

- Upload the manifest.zip to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")
   - Go to Microsoft Teams. From the lower left corner, select Apps
   - From the lower left corner, choose Upload a custom App
   - Go to your project directory, the ./AppManifest folder, select the zip folder, and choose Open.
   - Select Add in the pop-up dialog box. Your app is uploaded to Teams.

 - **Note**
 Kindly add the app/bot in personal scope and login there, afterwards add the app/bot in any Teams channel.

**Note**: If you are facing any issue in your app, please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/app-installation-using-qr-code/csharp/QRAppInstallation/AdapterWithErrorHandler.cs#L30) line and put your debugger for local debug.
