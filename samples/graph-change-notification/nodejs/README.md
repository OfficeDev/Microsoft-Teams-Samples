## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account (not a guest account)
- To test locally, [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) must be installed on your development machine (version 16.14.2  or higher)
- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) latest version or equivalent tunneling solution
- [M365 developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) or access to a Teams account with the 
- [Teams Toolkit for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) or [TeamsFx CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/teamsfx-cli?pivots=version-one)

## Run the app (Using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code.

**Note:** Please create and install self-signed certificate before running this sample using toolkit or manually.

1. Ensure you have downloaded and installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)
1. Install the [Teams Toolkit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension)
1. Select **File > Open Folder** in VS Code and choose this samples directory from the repo
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the app in a Teams web client.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.

> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (sideloading), Teams Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

## Setup
### Register you app with Azure AD.

  1. Register a new application in the [Microsoft Entra ID – App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.
  2. Select **New Registration** and on the *register an application page*, set following values:
      * Set **name** to your app name.
      * Choose the **supported account types** (any account type will work)
      * Leave **Redirect URI** empty.
      * Choose **Register**.
  3. On the overview page, copy and save the **Application (client) ID, Directory (tenant) ID**. You’ll need those later when updating your Teams application manifest and in the .env.
  4. Under **Manage**, select **Expose an API**. 
  5. Select the **Set** link to generate the Application ID URI in the form of `api://botid-{AppID}`. Insert your fully qualified domain name (with a forward slash "/" appended to the end) between the double forward slashes and the GUID. The entire ID should have the form of: `api://botid-{AppID}`
      * ex: `api://botid-00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`.
  6. Select the **Add a scope** button. In the panel that opens, enter `access_as_user` as the **Scope name**.
  7. Set **Who can consent?** to `Admins and users`
  8. Fill in the fields for configuring the admin and user consent prompts with values that are appropriate for the `access_as_user` scope:
      * **Admin consent title:** Teams can access the user’s profile.
      * **Admin consent description**: Allows Teams to call the app’s web APIs as the current user.
      * **User consent title**: Teams can access the user profile and make requests on the user's behalf.
      * **User consent description:** Enable Teams to call this app’s APIs with the same rights as the user.
  9. Ensure that **State** is set to **Enabled**
  10. Select **Add scope**
      * The domain part of the **Scope name** displayed just below the text field should automatically match the **Application ID** URI set in the previous step, with `/access_as_user` appended to the end:
          * `api://botid-00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/access_as_user.
  11. In the **Authorized client applications** section, identify the applications that you want to authorize for your app’s web application. Each of the following IDs needs to be entered:
      * `1fec8e78-bce4-4aaf-ab1b-5451cc387264` (Teams mobile/desktop application)
      * `5e3ce6c0-2b1f-4285-8d4b-75ee78787346` (Teams web application)
  12. Navigate to **API Permissions**, and make sure to add the follow permissions:
  -   Select Add a permission
  -   Select Microsoft Graph -\> Delegated permissions.
      - `User.Read` (enabled by default)
      - `Presence.Read`
      - `Presence.Read.All`
  -   Click on Add permissions. Please make sure to grant the admin consent for the required permissions.
  ![ApiPermission](Images/ApiPermission.png)
  13. Navigate to **Authentication**
      If an app hasn't been granted IT admin consent, users will have to provide consent the first time they use an app.
  - Set a redirect URI:
      * Select **Add a platform**.
      * Select **Web**.
      * Enter the **redirect URI** for the app in the following format: `https://token.botframework.com/.auth/web/redirect`.
  14.  Navigate to the **Certificates & secrets**. In the Client secrets section, click on "+ New client secret". Add a description(Name of the secret) for the secret and select “Never” for Expires. Click "Add". Once the client secret is created, copy its value, it need to be placed in the .env.

 2. Setup for Bot
    - In Azure portal, create a [Azure Bot resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-authentication?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp%2Caadv2).
	- Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
	- While registering the bot, use `https://<your_tunnel_domain>/api/messages` as the messaging endpoint.
	**NOTE:** When you create app registration, you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.
    
### Instruction on setting connection string for bot authentication on the behalf of user
   ![image](Images/BotConnection.png)

   - Select Add OAuth Connection Settings.

   - Complete the form as follows.

    a. Enter a name for the connection. You'll use this name in your bot in the .env file. For example BotTeamsAuthADv1.

    b. Service Provider. Select **Azure Active Directory**.

    c. Client id. Enter the Application (client) ID that you recorded for your Azure identity provider app in the steps above.

    d. Client secret. Enter the secret that you recorded for your Azure identity provider app in the steps above.

    e. Grant Type. Enter authorization_code.

    f. Login URL. Enter https://login.microsoftonline.com.

    g. Tenant ID, enter the Directory (tenant) ID that you recorded earlier for your Azure identity app or common depending on the supported account type selected when you created the identity provider app.

    h. For Resource URL, enter https://graph.microsoft.com/
    
    i. Provide  Scopes like "Presence.Read, Presence.Read.All"

3. Setup NGROK
 - Run ngrok - point to port 3978

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

4. Setup for code

  - Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```
  - Update the `.env` configuration for the bot to use the `MicrosoftAppId` and `MicrosoftAppPassword`,`connectionName` and `notificationUrl` (Note the MicrosoftAppId is the AppId created in step 1 (Setup for Bot), the MicrosoftAppPassword is referred to as the "client secret" in step 1 (Setup for Bot) and you can always create a new client secret anytime.) and connectionName we can get from step "Select your bot channel registration link." and for the `notificationUrl` eg.1234.ngrok-free.app/api/notifications
  
 - Open from Visual Studio code
    - Launch Visual Studio code
    - File -> Open Folder
    - Navigate to `samples/graph-change-notification/nodejs` folder
    - Run npm command  in the terminal
        ```bash
        npm install
        ``` 
    - Press `F5` to run the project
    
5. Setup Manifest for Teams
- __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the ./appManifest folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your app registration earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `{{Microsoft-App-Id}}` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` and replace `{{domain-name}}` with base Url of your domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `appManifest` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)

- Upload the manifest.zip to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")
   - Go to Microsoft Teams. From the lower left corner, select Apps
   - From the lower left corner, choose Upload a custom App
   - Go to your project directory, the ./appManifest folder, select the zip folder, and choose Open.
   - Select Add in the pop-up dialog box. Your app is uploaded to Teams.

**Note**: If you are facing any issue in your app, please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/graph-change-notification/nodejs/index.js#L42) line and put your debugger for local debug.
