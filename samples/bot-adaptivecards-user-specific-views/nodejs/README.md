# Teams Adaptive Card Views

- **Interaction with bot**
  ![UserSpecificView](Images/UserSpecificView_all.gif)

This sample demonstrates how to create user-specific views in Adaptive Cards within Microsoft Teams, using features like Action.Execute and auto-refresh for dynamic updates. The app enables personalized content, allowing seamless interaction across personal, group, and team contexts.

Specifically, it uses the Universal Action `Action.Execute` with `refresh` property, which enables developers to build different views for users in a common chat thread. 

Developers can consume this action to build different experiences in Teams like:
1. User-specific content in shared contexts like Group chat and Teams Channels.
2. Auto-update information in a card for a user in personal context / all users when they view it in a shared context. Think of updating an order status when a user views the message or an incident status when users view it.
3. Sequential workflows where each workflow is an adaptive card with user-specific view and options to invoke next / prev card.


For more details, refer to our [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/universal-actions-for-adaptive-cards/user-specific-views?tabs=mobile%2CC).

## How does it work?

Apps can define `refresh` property with details about the refresh event and optionally add a list of users for whom the card should automatically refresh. (Refer to the image below).

The sample implements the following cards:

1. `Me`: The Adaptive card is configured to automatically refresh for the sender only. The sender will notice that the card refreshes for them automatically when the bot posts it. (Refresh count will go from 0 to 1). Other users will not get automatic refreshes, but they will have an option to do a manual refresh.
2. `All Users`: The Adaptive card is configured to automatically refresh for all the users in the context (Chat / Channel). Note that this works when the total number of users is <=60. If the total number of users is greater than 60, users will have to manually refresh the card.

Both the cards have an option to `Update Base card`, this action updates the base card for all the users in the context. We remove the refresh property from the updated card and that stops further refresh invoke actions for all the users. You may decide to keep it to enable auto-refresh for all or list of users.

All the cards display the following information:
1. **Card Type**: `Me` or `All Users`
2. **Card Status**: `Base`, `Updated` and `Final`.
3. **Trigger**: `automatic` trigger or `manual` trigger.
4. **View**: `personal` (user specific view) or `shared view`.


You can extend the `Me` card to automatically refresh for a list of users by adding a list of user MRIs to `userIds` in Adaptive Card.

## User specific view - workflow

The following GIF captures `Automatic refresh`, `Manual refresh`, and `Update Base Card` actions in `Me` card.

![bot-conversations ](Images/UserSpecificView_Me.png)

The diagram above captures the sequence of events for `Me` card.

Workflow:
1. User A selects `Me` card type, and the Bot sends an Adaptive card which is configured to automatically refresh for User A
2. User A will initially have a Base card with refresh count 0 which will get refreshed automatically to count 1.
3. User B's Base card will not automatically refresh and the refresh count will remain 0. User B will have the option to manually refresh.

In the case of `All Users`, the refresh will automatically be invoked for all users (in this case for user B as well).

## Try it yourself - experience the App in your Microsoft Teams client
Please find below demo manifest which is deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading the app package (.zip file link below) to your teams and/or as a personal app. (Uploading must be enabled for your tenant, [see steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)).

**Microsoft Teams bot adaptivecards user specific views sample app:** [Manifest](/samples/bot-adaptivecards-user-specific-views/nodejs/demo-manifest/bot-adaptivecards-user-specific-views.zip)

## Prerequisites

-  Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account (not a guest account)
-  To test locally, [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) must be installed on your development machine (version 18.12.1)
-  [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) latest version or equivalent tunneling solution
-  [M365 developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) or access to a Teams account with the 
   appropriate permissions to install an app.
- [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) or [TeamsFx CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/teamsfx-cli?pivots=version-one)

## Run the app (Using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio Code)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio Code.

1. Ensure you have downloaded and installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)
1. Install the [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension)
1. Select **File > Open Folder** in VS Code and choose this samples directory from the repo
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the app in a Teams web client.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.

> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (uploading), Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

## Setup

1. Register a new application in the [Microsoft Entra ID â€“ App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.
      > NOTE: When you create your app registration, you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.

2. Setup for Bot:
  - Register a bot with Azure Bot Service, following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/abs-quickstart?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=userassigned).
  - Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
  - While registering the bot, use `https://<your_tunnel_domain>/api/messages` as the messaging endpoint.

3. Setup NGROK  
1) Run ngrok - point to port 3978

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

4. Setup For Code  
  - Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

  - Update the `.env` configuration for the bot to use the `MicrosoftAppId` and `MicrosoftAppPassword`. 
(**Note:** The MicrosoftAppId is the AppId created in step 1 (Setup Microsoft Entra ID app registration in your Azure portal), the MicrosoftAppPassword is referred to as the "client secret" in step 1 (Setup for Bot) and you can always create a new client secret anytime.)

  - In a terminal, navigate to `samples/bot-adaptivecards-user-specific-views/nodejs`

  - Install modules

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

  - Run your app

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
5. Setup Manifest for Teams
- __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the ./appManifest folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your app registration earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<Microsoft-AppId>>` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` and replace `<<Domain-Name>>` with base Url of your domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `appManifest` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)

- Upload the manifest.zip to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")
   - Go to Microsoft Teams. From the lower left corner, select Apps
   - From the lower left corner, choose Upload a custom App
   - Go to your project directory, the ./appManifest folder, select the zip folder, and choose Open.
   - Select Add in the pop-up dialog box. Your app is uploaded to Teams.

**Note**: If you are facing any issue in your app, please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/bot-adaptivecards-user-specific-views/nodejs/index.js#L44) line and put your debugger for local debug.

## FAQ

##### How to implement user-specific views in a group of >60 users?
If your scenario requires a user-specific view for all the users in a chat, we recommend you do the following:

1. Add a `manual refresh` action in the base card (like the sample app) so that users know they need to refresh it to see relevant content.
2. Leave the `userids` field empty. If the total number of users is <=60, refresh invoke will be triggered automatically for all the users, else all the users will see the base card and they can refresh it manually.

> Note: you can configure up to 60 users for whom auto-refresh should be triggered. (if your scenario allows you to prioritize certain user role types). Others will see the base card and can refresh it manually.

##### How frequently do Teams clients trigger auto-refresh for users?
Assuming the AC contains refresh logic that should auto-refresh for the user - 
Teams clients will trigger a refresh when a user views the message and the last refresh response is older than a minute.

>Note: Developers can control if they want to continuously refresh the content for a user or not.

If the developers do not want to continuously refresh a card for a user, they should remove the `refresh` property from the updated user-specific card response. (Refer sequence diagram - Response with updated AC for the user)

##### Is the user-specific view response for a user immediately available on all the Teams clients (Web, Desktop, and mobile)?
Teams caches the refresh invoke a response in clients. Every client will trigger a refresh invoke when the user views the message.

Consider following:
1. Bot sends an AC with user-specific views for all users in a chat.
2. User A logins to Teams desktop application and opens the chat.
3. User A will see the base card and the Teams client will trigger auto-refresh and display the updated refresh card received from the bot.
4. When the same user A logins to Teams mobile/web application, and opens the chat, he/she will see the base card, and Teams client will trigger an auto-refresh to get the updated card from the bot.
If User A opens the chat again on either of these clients, it will show the cached card (updated refresh card).
