# Teams Message Reactions Bot C# Sample

This sample app demonstrates the implementation of message reactions in Microsoft Teams using the Bot Framework. The bot responds dynamically to reactions, supporting personal, group, and team scopes, and is compatible with adaptive cards. It can be run locally with .NET SDK and tunneling solutions or deployed to Azure for broader use.

## Included Features
* Bots
* Adaptive Cards

## Try it yourself - experience the App in your Microsoft Teams client
Please find below demo manifest which is deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading the app manifest (.zip file link below) to your teams and/or as a personal app. (Uploading must be enabled for your tenant, [see steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)).

**Teams Message Reactions Bot:** [Manifest](/samples/bot-message-reaction/csharp/demo-manifest/bot-message-reaction.zip)

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account
- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 6.0
- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) latest version or equivalent tunnelling solution

## Run the app (Using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio.
1. Install Visual Studio 2022 **Version 17.14 or higher** [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
1. Install Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)
1. In the debug dropdown menu of Visual Studio, select Dev Tunnels > Create A Tunnel (set authentication type to Public) or select an existing public dev tunnel.
1. Right-click the 'M365Agent' project in Solution Explorer and select **Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit > Select Microsoft 365 Account**
1. Sign in to Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit with a **Microsoft 365 work or school account**
1. Set `Startup Item` as `Microsoft Teams (browser)`.
1. Press F5, or select Debug > Start Debugging menu in Visual Studio to start your app

1. In the opened web browser, select Add button to install the app in Teams
> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (uploading), Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

## Setup

> Note these instructions are for running the sample on your local machine, the tunnelling solution is required because the Teams service needs to call into the bot.

1) Run ngrok - point to port 3978

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```
1) Register a new application in the [Microsoft Entra ID – App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.
  
  A) Select **New Registration** and on the *register an application page*, set following values:
      * Set **name** to your app name.
      * Choose the **supported account types** (any account type will work)
      * Leave **Redirect URI** empty.
      * Choose **Register**.
  B) On the overview page, copy and save the **Application (client) ID, Directory (tenant) ID**. You'll need those later when updating your Teams application manifest and in the appsettings.json.
  C) Navigate to **API Permissions**, and make sure to add the following permissions:
   Select Add a permission
      * Select Add a permission
      * Select Microsoft Graph -\> Delegated permissions.
      * `User.Read` (enabled by default)
      * Click on Add permissions. Please make sure to grant the admin consent for the required permissions.
      
1) Setup for Bot

   In Azure portal, create a [Azure Bot resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration).
    - For bot handle, make up a name.
    - Select "Use existing app registration" (Create the app registration in Microsoft Entra ID beforehand.)
    - __*If you don't have an Azure account*__ create an [Azure free account here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
    
   In the new Azure Bot resource in the Portal, 
    - Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
    - In Settings/Configuration/Messaging endpoint, enter the current `https` URL you were given by running the tunneling application. Append with the path `/api/messages`

1) Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

1) If you are using Visual Studio
   - Launch Visual Studio
   - File -> Open -> Project/Solution
   - Navigate to `samples/bot-message-reaction/csharp/MessageReaction` folder
   - Select `MessageReaction.csproj` file
   - Press `F5` to run the project 

1) Update the `appsettings.json` configuration for the bot to use the BOT_ID, BOT_PASSWORD, BOT_TENANT_ID generated in Step 2 (App Registration creation). (Note the App Password is referred to as the "client secret" in the azure portal and you can always create a new client secret anytime.)
    - Also, set BOT_TYPE in the `appsettings.json`. (**Allowed values are: MultiTenant(default), SingleTenant, UserAssignedMSI**)

1) Run your bot, either from Visual Studio with `F5` or using `dotnet run` in the appropriate folder.

1) __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the  `appPackage` folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your bot earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID>>` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` with base Url domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `appPackage` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)
    - **Upload** the `manifest.zip` to Teams (In Teams Apps/Manage your apps click "Upload an app". Browse to and Open the .zip file. At the next dialog, click the Add button.)
    - Add the app in personal/groupchat/team scope (supported scopes)

**Note**: If you are facing any issue in your app, please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/bot-message-reaction/csharp/AdapterWithErrorHandler.cs#L24) line and put your debugger for local debug.

## Running the sample

Message the bot and it will respond with an 'Echo: [your message]'.  Add a message reaction to the bots response, and the bot will reply accordingly.
