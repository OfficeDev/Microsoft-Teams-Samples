## Try it yourself - experience the App in your Microsoft Teams client
Please find below demo manifest which is deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading the app manifest (.zip file link below) to your teams and/or as a personal app. (Sideloading must be enabled for your tenant, [see steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)).

**Receive Channel messages with RSC permissions:** [Manifest](/samples/bot-receive-channel-messages-withRSC/csharp/demo-manifest/Bot-RSC.zip)

## Prerequisites

- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 6.0

  determine dotnet version
  ```bash
  dotnet --version
  ```
- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) (For local environment testing) latest version (any other tunneling software can also be used)
  
- [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com) Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account


## Run the app (Using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio.
1. Install Visual Studio 2022 **Version 17.10 Preview 4 or higher** [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
1. Install Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio [Teams Toolkit extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)
1. In the debug dropdown menu of Visual Studio, select Dev Tunnels > Create A Tunnel (set authentication type to Public) or select an existing public dev tunnel.
1. In the debug dropdown menu of Visual Studio, select default startup project > **Microsoft Teams (browser)**
1. In Visual Studio, right-click your **TeamsApp** project and **Select Teams Toolkit > Prepare Teams App Dependencies**
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps.
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the menu in Visual Studio.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.
> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (sideloading), Teams Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

## Setup

1. Register a new application in the [Microsoft Entra ID â€“ App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.

2. Setup for Bot
- Register a Microsoft Entra ID aap registration in Azure portal.
- Also, register a bot with Azure Bot Service, following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration?view=azure-bot-service-3.0).
- Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
- While registering the bot, use `https://<your_tunnel_domain>/api/messages` as the messaging endpoint.

3. Setup Ngrok
-  Run ngrok - point to port 3978

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

4. Setup for code

- Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

- Modify the `/appsettings.json` and fill in the following details:
  - `{{BOT-ID}}` - Generated from Step 1 while doing Microsoft Entra ID app registration in Azure portal.
  - `{{BOT-PASSWORD}}` -Generated from Step 1, also referred to as Client secret 



- Run in Visual Studio

  - Launch Visual Studio
  - File -> Open -> Project/Solution
  - Navigate to `ReceiveMessagesWithRSC` folder
  - Select `ReceiveMessagesWithRSC.csproj` file
  - Press `F5` to run the project


5. This step is specific to Teams.
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the  `appPackage` folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your bot earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID>>` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`) also update the `<<DOMAIN-NAME>>` with the tunnel URL`
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `<<MANIFEST-ID>>` replace it with any `GUID` using guid generator.
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `webApplicationInfo` resource `"api://botid-{{MicrosoftAppId}}"` with MicrosoftAppId. E.g. `"api://botid-{{MicrosoftAppId}}"`.
    
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `appPackage` folder to create a `manifest.zip`
    - **Sideload** in a team to test
         - Select or create a team
         - Select the ellipses **...** from the left pane. The drop-down menu appears.
         - Select **Manage Team**, then select **Apps** 
         - Then select **Upload a custom app** from the lower right corner.
         - Then select the `manifest.zip` file from `appPackage`, and then select **Add** to add the bot to your selected team.

**Note**: If you are facing any issue in your app, please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/bot-receive-channel-messages-withRSC/csharp/ReceiveMessagesWithRSC/AdapterWithErrorHandler.cs#L24) line and put your debugger for local debug.

## Interacting with the bot in Teams

Select a channel and enter a message in the channel for your bot.

The bot receives the message without being @mentioned.
