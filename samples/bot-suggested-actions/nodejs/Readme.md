# Send Suggested Actions

This sample shows the feature where user can [send suggested actions](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/conversations/conversation-messages?tabs=dotnet#send-suggested-actions) using bot.

## Included Features
* Bots
* Suggested Actions

## Interaction with app

## Try it yourself - experience the App in your Microsoft Teams client
Please find below demo manifest which is deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading the app package (.zip file link below) to your teams and/or as a personal app. (Uploading must be enabled for your tenant, [see steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)).

**Send Suggested Actions:** [Manifest](/samples/bot-suggested-actions/csharp/demo-manifest/bot-suggested-actions.zip)

## Prerequisites

-  Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account (not a guest account)
-  To test locally, [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) must be installed on your development machine (version 16.14.2  or higher)
-  [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) latest version or equivalent tunneling solution
-  [M365 developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) or access to a Teams account with the 
   appropriate permissions to install an app.

- [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) or [TeamsFx CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/teamsfx-cli?pivots=version-one)

## Run the app (Using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio Code)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio Code.

1. Ensure you have downloaded and installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)
1. Install the [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension)
1. Select **File > Open Folder** in VS Code and choose this samples directory from the repo
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the app in a Teams web client.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.
> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (uploading), Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

## Setup

> Note these instructions are for running the sample on your local machine, the tunnelling solution is required because
> the Teams service needs to call into the bot.

1. Register a new application in the [Microsoft Entra ID â€“ App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.

2. Setup for Bot
- Register Azure AD application resource in Azure portal
- In Azure portal, create a [Azure Bot resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-authentication?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp%2Caadv2).
- Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
- While registering the bot, use `https://<your_tunnel_domain>/api/messages` as the messaging endpoint.

	**NOTE:** When you create your bot you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.

3. Setup NGROK  
 - Run ngrok - point to port 3978

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

4. Setup for code  
  - Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```
  - Update the `.env` configuration for the bot to use the `MicrosoftAppId` and `MicrosoftAppPassword`. (Note the MicrosoftAppId is the AppId created in step 1 (Setup Microsoft Entra ID app registration in your Azure portal), the MicrosoftAppPassword is referred to as the "client secret" in step 1 (Setup for Bot) and you can always create a new client secret anytime.)
- In a terminal, navigate to `samples/bot-suggested-actions/nodejs`

- Install modules

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

 - Run your app

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

5. Setup Manifest for Teams
- __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the ./appManifest folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your app registration earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `{{Microsoft-App-Id}}` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` and replace `{{domain-name}}` with base Url of your domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `appManifest` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)

- Upload the manifest.zip to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")
   - Go to Microsoft Teams. From the lower left corner, select Apps
   - From the lower left corner, choose Upload a custom App
   - Go to your project directory, the ./appManifest folder, select the zip folder, and choose Open.
   - Select Add in the pop-up dialog box. Your app is uploaded to Teams.

**Note**: If you are facing any issue in your app, please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/bot-suggested-actions/nodejs/index.js#L44) line and put your debugger for local debug.
