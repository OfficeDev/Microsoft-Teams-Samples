## Try it yourself - experience the App in your Microsoft Teams client
Please find below demo manifest which is deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading the app package (.zip file link below) to your teams and/or as a personal app. (Sideloading must be enabled for your tenant, [see steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)).

**Microsoft Teams hello world sample app:** [Manifest](/samples/app-hello-world/csharp/demo-manifest/app-hello-world.zip)

## Prerequisites

- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 6.0

  ```bash
  # determine dotnet version
  dotnet --version
  ```
- Publicly addressable https url or tunnel such as [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) latest version or [Tunnel Relay](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-tunnelrelay)

## Run the app (Using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio.
1. Install Visual Studio 2022 **Version 17.10 Preview 4 or higher** [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
1. Install Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio [Teams Toolkit extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)
1. In the debug dropdown menu of Visual Studio, select Dev Tunnels > Create A Tunnel (set authentication type to Public) or select an existing public dev tunnel.
1. In the debug dropdown menu of Visual Studio, select default startup project > **Microsoft Teams (browser)**
1. In Visual Studio, right-click your **TeamsApp** project and **Select Teams Toolkit > Prepare Teams App Dependencies**
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps.
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the menu in Visual Studio.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.
> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (sideloading), Teams Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

## Setup

### 1. Setup for Bot
- Register a bot with Azure Bot Service, following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration?view=azure-bot-service-3.0).

- Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)

- While registering the bot, use `https://<your_tunnel_domain>/api/messages` as the messaging endpoint.
    > NOTE: When you create your bot you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.

### 2. Setup NGROK
1) Run ngrok - point to port 5000

    ```bash
    ngrok http 5000 --host-header="localhost:5000"
    ```
   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 5000 --allow-anonymous
   ```

### 3. Setup for code
- Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```
 Run the bot from a terminal or from Visual Studio:

  A) From a terminal, navigate to `Microsoft.Teams.Samples.HelloWorld.Web`

  ```bash
  # run the bot
  dotnet run
  ```

  B) Or from Visual Studio

  - Launch Visual Studio
  - File -> Open -> Project/Solution
  - Navigate to `Microsoft.Teams.Samples.HelloWorld.Web` folder
  - Select `Microsoft.Teams.Samples.HelloWorld.Web.csproj` file
  - Press `F5` to run the project   


### 4. Setup Manifest for Teams

- **This step is specific to Teams.**

1) Modify the `manifest.json` in the `/AppManifest` folder and replace the following details:
  - `{{Microsoft-App-Id}}` with Application id generated from Step 1
  - `{{domain-name}}` with base Url domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.

  **Note:** If you want to test your app across multi hub like: Outlook/Office.com, please update the `manifest.json` in the `/AppManifest_Hub` folder with the required values.

2) Zip the contents of `appPackage` or `AppManifest_Hub` folder into a `manifest.zip`.

3) Modify the `/appsettings.json` and fill in the following details:
  - `{{Microsoft-App-Id}}` - Generated from Step 1 is the application app id
  - `{{ Microsoft-App-Password}}` - Generated from Step 1, also referred to as Client secret
  - `{{ Application Base Url }}` - Your application's base url. E.g. https://12345.ngrok-free.app if you are using ngrok and if you are using dev tunnels, your URL will be https://12345.devtunnels.ms.
  
5) Upload the manifest.zip to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")
   - Go to Microsoft Teams. From the lower left corner, select Apps
   - From the lower left corner, choose Upload a custom App
   - Go to your project directory, the ./appPackage folder, select the zip folder, and choose Open.
   - Select Add in the pop-up dialog box. Your app is uploaded to Teams.

This app has a default landing capability that determines whether the opening scope is set to the Bot or a static tab. Without configuring this, Microsoft Teams defaults to landing on the bot in desktop clients and tab in mobile clients.

To set the **Bot as the default landing capability**, configure the 'staticTabs' section in the manifest as follows:
```bash
"staticTabs": [
  {
    "entityId": "conversations",
    "scopes": [
      "personal"
    ]
  },
  {
    "entityId": "com.contoso.helloworld.hellotab",
    "name": "Hello Tab",
    "contentUrl": "https://${{BOT_DOMAIN}}/hello",
    "scopes": [
      "personal"
    ]
  }
],
```

To set the **Tab as the default landing capability**, configure the 'staticTabs' section in the manifest as follows:
```bash
"staticTabs": [
  {
    "entityId": "com.contoso.helloworld.hellotab",
    "name": "Hello Tab",
    "contentUrl": "https://${{BOT_DOMAIN}}/hello",
    "scopes": [
      "personal"
    ]
  },
  {
    "entityId": "conversations",
    "scopes": [
      "personal"
    ]
  }
],
```

**Note**: If you are facing any issue in your app, please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/app-hello-world/csharp/Microsoft.Teams.Samples.HelloWorld.Web/AdapterWithErrorHandler.cs#L24) line and put your debugger for local debug.
