## Try it yourself - experience the App in your Microsoft Teams client
Please find below demo manifest which is deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading the app package (.zip file link below) to your teams and/or as a personal app. (Sideloading must be enabled for your tenant, [see steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)).

**Microsoft Teams Cookie App Demo Manifest:** [Manifest](/samples/tab-app-cookie/js/demo-manifest/tab-app-cookie.zip)

## Prerequisites

- To test locally, [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) must be installed on your development machine (version 16.14.2  or higher).

- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) latest version or equivalent tunnelling solution

## Setup

2. Setup NGROK
 - Run ngrok - point to port 3000

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000 --host-header="localhost:3000"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3000 --allow-anonymous
   ```

3. Setup for code

  - Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```
  
   - Install node modules

     Inside js folder,  navigate to `samples/tab-app-cookie/js` open your local terminal and run the below command to install node modules. You can do the same in Visual   
     Studio code terminal by opening the project in Visual Studio code.

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
    
  - Navigate to `./cookies.js` and go to line 23. Replace `{{DOMAIN-NAME}}` with your domain. E.g. if you   are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your DOMAIN-NAME will be `1234.ngrok-free.app`
    
    ```javascript
      function popOutApp() {
        window.open("https://{{DOMAIN-NAME}}/partitioned-cookies.html");
    }
    ```

  - Run the sample by following command:

    ```
    npm start
    ``` 

4. Setup Manifest for Teams
- __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` file located in the ./appPackage folder  and replace the placeholder `{{ANY-GUID-ID}}` with the corresponding GUID.
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` and replace `{{DOMAIN-NAME}}` with base Url of your domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your DOMAIN-NAME will be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.
    - **Zip** the contents of the `appPackage` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure the zip file does not contain any subfolders, as this will result in an error when uploading your .zip package).

- Upload the manifest.zip to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")
   - Go to Microsoft Teams. From the lower left corner, select Apps
   - From the lower left corner, choose Upload a custom App
   - Go to your project directory, the ./appPackage folder, select the zip folder, and choose Open.
   - Select Add in the pop-up dialog box. Your app is uploaded to Teams.
