# Channel and group tabs in ASP.NET Core with MVC

Discover how to create custom channel and group tabs in Microsoft Teams using ASP.NET Core and MVC in this comprehensive sample app. This guide walks you through the entire process, from setting up your development environment and configuring the app manifest to testing the integration with local tunneling solutions like Ngrok

## Prerequisites

- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 6.0

  determine dotnet version
  ```bash
  dotnet --version
  ```
- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) (For local environment testing) latest version (any other tunneling software can also be used)
  
- [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com) Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account

- [Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)

## Run the app (Using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio.
1. Install Visual Studio 2022 **Version 17.10 Preview 4  or higher** [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
1. Install Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio [Teams Toolkit extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)
1. In the debug dropdown menu of Visual Studio, select default startup project > **Microsoft Teams (browser)**
1. In Visual Studio, right-click your **TeamsApp** project and **Select Teams Toolkit > Prepare Teams App Dependencies**
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps.
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the menu in Visual Studio.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.
> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (sideloading), Teams Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

## Try it yourself - experience the App in your Microsoft Teams client
Please find below demo manifest which is deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading the app manifest (.zip file link below) to your teams and/or as a personal app. (Sideloading must be enabled for your tenant, [see steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)).

**Channel and group tabs in ASP.NET Core with MVC:** [Manifest](/samples/tab-channel-group/mvc-csharp/demo-manifest/tab-channel-group.zip)

## Setup

1. Run ngrok - point to port 3978

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

2. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
   ```

3. If you are using Visual Studio
 - Launch Visual Studio
 - File -> Open -> Project/Solution
 - Navigate to ```samples\tab-channel-group\mvc-csharp``` folder
 - Select ```ChannelGroupTabMVC.sln``` file and open the solution

4. Modify the `manifest.json` in the `/appPackage` folder and replace the following details:
   - `<<Guid>>` with any random GUID.
   - `<<Base-url>>` with base Url domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.
   - `validDomains` with base Url domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.

5. Upload the manifest.zip to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")
   - Go to Microsoft Teams. From the lower left corner, select Apps
   - From the lower left corner, choose Upload a custom App
   - Go to your project directory, the ./appPackage folder, select the zip folder, and choose Open.
