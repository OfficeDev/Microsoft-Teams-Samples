# Microsoft Teams outgoing webhook sample

This project is an implementation of a very simple [Outgoing Webhook](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/custom-bot) for Microsoft Teams. All it does is verify that what's sending messages matches the Outgoing Webhook that was created in Teams, and it echoes back whatever is sent to it.

## Steps to run on Lambda

### Prerequisites

- Install Git for windows: https://git-for-windows.github.io/

- Clone this repo:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/msteams-samples-outgoing-webhook-nodejs.git
  ```

- Create api gateway and use lambda as backend: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/getting-started.html

- Create the Outgoing Webhook in Teams using the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/custom-bot). Paste the tunneling service URL from the previous step into the "Callback URL" box. After you press the Create button, copy/paste the security token that Teams generates to the clipboard.

- Paste the security token generated by Teams as the value of `SHARED_SECRET` in `index.py`. When you're done, it should look something like this:

  ```python
  const SHARED_SECRET = "+ZaRRMC8+mpnfGaGsBOmkIFt98bttL5YQRq3p2tXgcE=";
  ```

- Update your lambda code with index.py content: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started.html

- In Microsoft Teams, in any channel in the team in which you created the Outgoing Webhook, you can type `@<botname> hello` (or anything else you like) and it will echo back its name and what you typed.
