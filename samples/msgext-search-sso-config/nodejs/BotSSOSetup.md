## Bot SSO Setup
This document guide you to setup AAD and Azure Bot Service, which are the pre-requisites steps to enable Bot SSO.

### 1. Create and configure AAD app

#### 1.1 Create AAD app for SSO

This step will create an AAD app, it will be reused wherever it needs AAD throughout this sample to simpler the steps.

- Navigate to [Azure _App Registration_ Blade](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade)

- Click "New Registration" on the upper left corner

- Fill out name and select third option for supported account type 
- Set Redirect Uri to "https://token.botframework.com/.auth/web/redirect" and click "Register":

- Navigate to the AAD app you just created, _copy and paste the Application ID(will referred as **AppId** in this document) somewhere safe_. You'll need it in a future step:
    ![Save Application ID](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/main/samples/bot-conversation-sso-quickstart/js/sso_media/AppId.png)

#### 1.2 Create Client Secret

- Navigate to the "Certificates & secrets" blade and add a client secret by clicking "New Client Secret"

    ![New Secret](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/main/samples/bot-conversation-sso-quickstart/js/sso_media/ClientSecret.png)
</br>

- _Copy and paste the secret value somewhere safe_. You'll need it in a future step

#### 1.3. Expose API endpoint

- Click "_Expose an API_" in the left rail

    - Set your Application ID URL to include your bot id - api://botid-<AppId>, where <AppId> is the id of the bot that will be making the SSO request and found in your Teams Application Manifest, which is the same you create and saved in step1.1:
    ![Application ID URI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/main/samples/bot-conversation-sso-quickstart/js/sso_media/AppIdUri.png)

    - Click "_Add a scope_"

        - access_as_user as the Scope name.

        - Set Who can consent? to Admins and users

        - Fill in the fields for configuring the admin and user consent prompts with values that are appropriate for the access_as_user scope. Suggestions:

            - Admin consent display name: Teams can access the user’s profile

            - Admin consent description: Allows Teams to call the app’s web APIs as the current user.

            - User consent display name: Teams can access your user profile and make requests on your behalf

            - User consent description: Enable Teams to call this app’s APIs with the same rights that you have

        - Ensure that State is set to Enabled

        - Click on Add scope button (Note: The domain part of the Scope name displayed just below the text field should automatically match the Application ID URI set in the previous step, with /access_as_user appended to the end)

#### 1.4. Authorize client applications

Add the following Ids as authorized clients for your application

- 1fec8e78-bce4-4aaf-ab1b-5451cc387264 (Teams mobile/desktop application)

- 5e3ce6c0-2b1f-4285-8d4b-75ee78787346 (Teams web application)

    ![Add Client Application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/main/samples/bot-conversation-sso-quickstart/js/sso_media/AddClient.png)

#### 1.5. Add any necessary API permissions for downstream calls

- Navigate to "API permissions" blade on the left hand side

- Add any user delegated permissions that your app will need to downstream APIs. This quick start only requires User.Read.

#### 1.6. Enable implicit grant

- Navigate to "Authentication"

- Check the *Access tokens* and *ID tokens* boxes and click on Save button.

### 2. Setup bot in Azure Bot Service

#### 2.1. Run ngrok - point to port 3978

```bash
ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
```

#### 2.2. Create new Azure Bot resource in Azure

Create [Azure Bot resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration) in Azure

- Select Type of App as "Multi Tenant" or as per your need
- Select Creation type as "Use existing app registration"
- Use the copied AppId from the above step and fill in AppId.
- Click on Create on the Azure bot.
- Go to the created resource, navigate to channels and ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)

- Go to the created resource, navigate to and update the "_Messaging endpoint_", use the current `https` URL you were given by running ngrok. Append with the path `/api/messages`:
- For "Microsoft App ID and password", click "Create New", fill in the AppId and client secret you created in step1.1 and step 1.2:
    ![Create Azure Bot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/main/samples/bot-conversation-sso-quickstart/js/sso_media/CreateBot.png)

    ![Create Azure Bot2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/main/samples/bot-conversation-sso-quickstart/js/sso_media/CreateBot2.png)

- After you select *Create*, it will take a few moments for your bot service to be provisioned. Once you see a notification indicating the validation process is complete, navigate back to *Home > Bot Services* to find your bot. You may have to refresh the page to see your bot listed.
- Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)

### 3. Setup Bot Service Connection (TokenStore)

- In the Azure Portal, navigate back to the Azure Bot resource created in Step 2
   
    
- Switch to the "Settings" blade and click "Add Setting" under the OAuth Connection Settings section

    ![Add OAuth Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/main/samples/bot-conversation-sso-quickstart/js/sso_media/AddOauth.png)

- Fill out the Connection Setting form

    - Enter a name for your new Connection setting. This will be the name that gets referenced inside the settings of your bot service code in step 5

    - In the Service Provider dropdown, select Azure Active Directory V2

    - Enter in the client id and client secret obtained in step 1.1 and 1.2

    - For the Token Exchange URL use the Application ID URL obtained in step 1.3

    - Specify "common" as the Tenant ID

    - Add all the scopes configured when specifying permissions to downstream APIs in step 1.3

    - Click "Save"
