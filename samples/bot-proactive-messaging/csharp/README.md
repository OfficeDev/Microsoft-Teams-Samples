## Interaction with app

## Prerequisites
- Microsoft Teams account
- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 6.0
- Publicly addressable https url or tunnel such as [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) latest version or [Tunnel Relay](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-tunnelrelay) 

## Setup
1. Configure public url to point to http port 5000

   ```bash
   ngrok http 5000 --host-header="localhost:5000"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 5000 --allow-anonymous
   ```

2. Create a Microsoft Entra ID app registration and Azure Bot in Azure portal: [Azure Bot registration resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration).

- Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
- configure the messaging endpoint in Azure bot with your application domain URL and append `/api/messages` like: `https://111xxx.ngrok-free.app/api/messages`

3. Modify the `manifest.json` in the `/AppManifest` folder and replace the `{{BOT-ID}}` with the id received while doing Microsoft Entra ID app registration in previous steps and also update the `<<App Domain>>` with your application domain like ngrok domain: `111xxx.ngrok-free.app` or dev tunnels domain: `12345.devtunnels.ms` excluding http/https.

4. Zip the contents of `AppManifest` into a `manifest.zip`.

5. Modify the `/coordinate-logger/appsettings.local.json` file and fill in the `{{ Bot Id }}` and `{{ Bot Password }}` with the id's received while doing Microsoft Entra ID app registration in previous steps.


**Coordinate Logger**

***Note this is a noisy application, it is recommended you not run this in shared teams where you would disturb other users!***

1. Start the application

    ```bash
    # dotnet run
    ```
    It is running when the following output is displayed.
    ```
    Hosting environment: Development
    Content root path: C:\msteams-samples-proactive-messaging\coordinate-logger
    Now listening on: https://localhost:5001
    Now listening on: http://localhost:5000
    Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
    ```

2. Install the app personally in Teams
    - Go to the `Apps` in the left rail
    - Select `Upload a custom app` and select the manifest.json file
    - Click the `Add` Button on the consent screen

    The coordinates of the user should be log in the console window(refer above image)

3. Install the app to a Team
    - Go to the `Apps` in the left rail
    - Select `Upload a custom app` and select the manifest.json file
    - Select the down arrow next to the `Add` Button on the consent screen
    - Select a Team to install to. 

    The app will send a message to each channel in the Team & log the coordinates
    for each new thread to the console window.(refer above image)

**Proactive CMD**

1. Send a message to a user
    Using the values from the Coordinate Logger for a User's conversation coordinates & Bot registration fill in the parameters to the following command.

    ```bash
    # dotnet run -- sendUserMessage --app-id="{{Bot Id}}" --app-password="{{Bot Password}}" --service-url="{{ServiceUrl}}" --conversation-id="{{Conversation Id}}" --message="Send Message to a User"
    ```

    This will send a message to the 1-on-1 conversation with the user

2. Send a message to a thread
    Using the values from the Coordinate Logger for a Channel Thread's conversation coordinates & Bot registration fill in the parameters to the following command.

    ```bash
    # dotnet run -- sendChannelThread --app-id="{{Bot Id}}" --app-password="{{Bot Password}}" --service-url="{{ServiceUrl}}" --conversation-id="{{Conversation Id}}" --message="Send Message to a Thread"
    ```

    This will send a message to the thread

## Key concepts

The two samples correspond with two of the most common challenges when building proactive messaging apps in Microsoft Teams, getting the conversation coordinates and sending messages reliably. 

The `CoordinateLoggerActivityHandler.cs` file in the Conversation Logger demonstrates three separate ways to obtain or generate conversation coordinates for users or channel threads using the BotBuilder SDK.

The `SendWithRetries` function and policy from the `CreatePolicy` function demonstrate how to reliably send messages when dealing with throttling from Microsoft Teams.
