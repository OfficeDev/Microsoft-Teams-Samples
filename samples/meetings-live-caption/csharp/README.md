# Meeting side panel application uses CART link to send caption in live meeting.

This sample application showcases how to implement live captioning in Microsoft Teams using CART links. With features like a meeting side panel, chat integration, and configurable settings, this app enables real-time captioning to enhance accessibility during meetings.

Once the meeting is scheduled, follow this doc to enable [Provide Cart Catptions](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-cart-captions-in-a-microsoft-teams-meeting-human-generated-captions-2dd889e8-32a8-4582-98b8-6c96cf14eb47).
Copy the CART link it will used while configuring tab for meeting.

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account (not a guest account)
-  .[NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) SDK.
    ```bash
        # determine dotnet version
        dotnet --version
    ```
-  [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) latest version or equivalent tunneling solution
-  [M365 developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) or access to a Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app.
-  [Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)

## Run the app (Using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio.
1. Install Visual Studio 2022 **Version 17.10 Preview 4  or higher** [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
1. Install Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio [Teams Toolkit extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)
1. In the debug dropdown menu of Visual Studio, select default startup project > **Microsoft Teams (browser)**
1. In Visual Studio, right-click your **TeamsApp** project and **Select Teams Toolkit > Prepare Teams App Dependencies**
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps.
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the menu in Visual Studio.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.
> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (sideloading), Teams Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

## Setup.

> Note these instructions are for running the sample on your local machine, the tunnelling solution is required because
> the Teams service needs to call into the bot.

1) Run ngrok - point to port 3978

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

1) Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

1) Open the code in Visual Studio
   - File -> Open -> Project/Solution
   - Navigate to folder where repository is cloned then `samples/meetings-live-caption/csharp/MeetingLiveCaption.sln`

1) Run the bot from Visual Studio:
   - Press `F5` to run the project

1) Modify the `manifest.json` in the `/appPackage` folder and replace the following details:
   - `<<AppId>>` with any GUID id value.
   - `<<App-Domain>>` with base Url domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.

1) Zip the contents of `appPackage` folder into a `manifest.zip`, and use the `manifest.zip` to deploy in app store or add to Teams using step 6.

1) Upload the manifest.zip to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")
   - Go to Microsoft Teams and then go to side panel, select Apps
   - Choose Manage your apps -> Upload an app -> Upload a custom App
   - Go to your project directory, the ./appPackage folder, select the zip folder, and choose Open.
   - Select Add in the pop-up dialog box. Your app is uploaded to Teams.

**NOTE: If you are not able to send caption, try configuring tab again.**
