# Teams Toolkit v5.0 Pre-release

### What does pre-release mean?
Pre-release is meant for those who are eager to try the latest Teams Toolkit features and fixes. Even though pre-releases are not intended for use in production, they are at a sufficient quality level for you to generally use and [provide feedback](https://aka.ms/ttk-feedback). However, pre-release versions can and probably will change, and those changes could be major.

We've addressed a number of reported bugs and added major changes in this release based on your feedback to make Teams Toolkit more flexible. Some of the key highlights to these changes include:

- Use existing infrastructure, resource groups, and more when provisioning
- Use an existing Teams app ID
- Use an existing Azure AD app registration ID
- Use a different tunneling solution or customize the defaults
- Add custom steps to debugging, provisioning, deploying, publishing, etc.

### What about my existing Teams Toolkit projects?
The changes in this pre-release require upgrades to the TeamsFx configuration files. We recommend that you create a new app using this version. In the future, we'll provide a way to automatically upgrade existing Teams apps that were created with a previous version of Teams Toolkit.

# How to use this Teams Tab app HelloWorld app

Microsoft Teams supports the ability to run web-based UI inside "custom tabs" that users can install either for just themselves (personal tabs) or within a team or group chat context.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 14, 16, 18
- An M365 account. If you do not have M365 account, apply one from [M365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program)
- [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version after 4.0.0 or [TeamsFx CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli)

## Debug

- From Visual Studio Code: Start debugging the project by hitting the `F5` key in Visual Studio Code.
- Alternatively use the `Run and Debug Activity Panel` in Visual Studio Code and click the `Run and Debug` green arrow button.
- From TeamsFx CLI: 
  - Executing the command `teamsfx provision --env local` in your project directory.
  - Executing the command `teamsfx deploy --env local` in your project directory.
  - Executing the command `teamsfx preview --env local` in your project directory.

## Edit the manifest

You can find the Teams app manifest in `./appPackage` folder. The folder contains one manifest file:
* `manifest.json`: Manifest file for Teams app running locally or running remotely (After deployed to Azure).

This file contains template arguments with `${{...}}` statements which will be replaced at build time. You may add any extra properties or permissions you require to this file. See the [schema reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema) for more information.

## Deploy to Azure

Deploy your project to Azure by following these steps:

| From Visual Studio Code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | From TeamsFx CLI                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

- From Visual Studio Code

  1. Open the `Run and Debug Activity Panel`.
  1. Select `Launch Remote (Edge)` or `Launch Remote (Chrome)` from the launch configuration drop-down.
  1. Press the Play (green arrow) button to launch your app - now running remotely from Azure.

- From TeamsFx CLI: execute `teamsfx preview --env dev` in your project directory to launch your application.

## Validate manifest file

To check that your manifest file is valid:

- From Visual Studio Code: open the command palette and select: `Teams: Validate manifest file`.
- From TeamsFx CLI: run command `teamsfx validate` in your project directory.

## Package

- From Visual Studio Code: open the Teams Toolkit and click `Zip Teams app package` or open the command palette and select `Teams: Zip Teams app package`.
- Alternatively, from the command line run `teamsfx package` in the project directory.

## Publish to Teams

Once deployed, you may want to distribute your application to your organization's internal app store in Teams. Your app will be submitted for admin approval.

- From Visual Studio Code: open the Teams Toolkit and click `Publish to Teams` or open the command palette and select: `Teams: Publish to Teams`.
- From TeamsFx CLI: run command `teamsfx publish` in your project directory.

## Add Single Sign On feature

Microsoft Teams provides a mechanism by which an application can obtain the signed-in Teams user token to access Microsoft Graph (and other APIs). Teams Toolkit facilitates this interaction by abstracting some of the Azure Active Directory (AAD) flows and integrations behind some simple, high-level APIs. This enables you to add single sign-on (SSO) features easily to your Teams application.

Please follow this [document](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-add-sso) to add single sign on for your project.
