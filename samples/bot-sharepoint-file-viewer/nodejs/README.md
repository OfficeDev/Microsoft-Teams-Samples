## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account (not a guest account)
-  [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-  [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) latest version or equivalent tunneling solution
-  [M365 developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) or access to a Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app.

## Setup

### 1. Setup for Bot SSO
Refer to [Bot SSO Setup document](BotSSOSetup.md).

### 2. Setup NGROK
1) Run ngrok - point to port 3978

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

### 3. Setup SharePoint Site.
1) SharePoint site configuration
   - Login to [sharepoint](https://www.office.com/launch/sharepoint?auth=2)
   - Click on `Create site` and select `Team site`
   
   ![Team Site](Images/teamSite.png)
   
   - Enter site name and description of site.
   
   ![Site name](Images/siteName.png).
   
2) From site address eg: 'https://m365x357260.sharepoint.com/sites/SharePointTestSite'
      `m365x357260.sharepoint.com` - value is sharepoint tenant name.
	  
   - Click on next. (optional step)Add aditional owner and member.
   - Click on Finish.

### 4. Setup for code

1) Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

2) In a terminal, navigate to `samples/bot-sharepoint-file-viewer/nodejs`

3) Install modules

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

  If you face any dependency error while installing node modules, try using below command

    ```bash
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```

4) Update the `.env` configuration for the bot to use the MicrosoftAppId, MicrosoftAppPassword, MicrosoftAppTenantId and ConnectionName generated in Step 1 (Setup for Bot SSO). (Note the App Password is referred to as the "client secret" in the azure portal and you can always create a new client secret anytime.)
 - `ApplicationBaseUrl` will be your app's base url. For eg `https://xxxx.ngrok-free.app` if you are using Ngrok and if you are using dev tunnels, your URL will be like: https://12345.devtunnels.ms.
 - `SharePointTenantName` will be the tenant name generated in step 3.2.
 - `SharePointSiteName` will be the site name created in step 3.

5) Run your bot at the command line:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
### 5. Setup Manifest for Teams
1) __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the  `appManifest` folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your bot earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<Microsoft-App-Id>>` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` with base Url domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `appManifest` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)
    - **Upload** the `manifest.zip` to Teams (In Teams Apps/Manage your apps click "Upload an app". Browse to and Open the .zip file. At the next dialog, click the Add button.)
    - Add the app to personal/team/groupChat scope (Supported scopes)

**Note**: If you are facing any issue in your app, please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/bot-sharepoint-file-viewer/nodejs/index.js#L60) line and put your debugger for local debug.

## Running the sample

You can interact with this bot in Teams by sending it a message, or selecting a command from the command list. The bot will respond to the following strings.

1) The `viewfile` command will list all the files that are uploaded to sharepoint site.
![View files](Images/viewfile.png)

1) The `uploadfile` command will return a card, which will open a task module from where new files can be uploaded to sharepoint.

1) The files will be uploaded to sharepoint.
