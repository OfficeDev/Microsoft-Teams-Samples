# Teams Search Auth Config 

Bot Framework v4 sample for Teams expands the [msgext-search-auth-config](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/tree/main/samples/msgext-search-auth-config/csharp) sample to include a configuration page and Bot Service authentication.
This comprehensive C# sample provides a step-by-step guide for building a search-based Messaging Extension in Microsoft Teams that integrates authentication through Azure Active Directory. By utilizing the [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com) and Microsoft Graph API, it showcases how to implement secure user sign-in, access user data, and leverage messaging extension capabilities, enhancing the overall user experience.

In this sample we are assuming the OAuth 2 provider is Azure Active Directory V2 (AADv2) and are utilizing the Microsoft Graph API to retrieve data about the user. Check [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-authentication) for information about getting an AADv2 application setup for use in Azure Bot Service. The scopes used in this sample are the following:

- `email`
- `openid`
- `profile`
- `Mail.Read`
- `User.Read`
- `User.ReadBasic.All`
- `Mail.Send.Shared`

## Included Features
* Bots
* Message Extensions (with teams sso)
* Search Commands

## Interaction With Messaging Extension Auth

## Try it yourself - experience the App in your Microsoft Teams client
Please find below demo manifest which is deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading the app manifest (.zip file link below) to your teams and/or as a personal app. (Sideloading must be enabled for your tenant, [see steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)).

**Messaging Extension Auth:** [Manifest](/samples/msgext-search-auth-config/csharp/demo-manifest/msgext-search-auth-config.zip)

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account
- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 6.0
- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) latest version or equivalent tunnelling solution
- [Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)

## Description

- Teams Messaging Extension Auth Configuration [Microsoft Entra Authentication] for search, action and link unfurling combined in the sample. 
- [Add Authentication to your Bot](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/authentication/add-authentication?tabs=dotnet%2Cdotnet-sample#create-the-bot-channels-registration)

## Run the app (Using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio.
1. Install Visual Studio 2022 **Version 17.10 Preview 4 or higher** [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
1. Install Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio [Teams Toolkit extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)
1. In the debug dropdown menu of Visual Studio, select Dev Tunnels > Create A Tunnel (set authentication type to Public) or select an existing public dev tunnel.
1. In the debug dropdown menu of Visual Studio, select default startup project > **Microsoft Teams (browser)**
1. In Visual Studio, right-click your **TeamsApp** project and **Select Teams Toolkit > Prepare Teams App Dependencies**
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps.
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the menu in Visual Studio.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.
> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (sideloading), Teams Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

## Setup

> Note these instructions are for running the sample on your local machine, the tunnelling solution is required because
the Teams service needs to call into the bot.

### 1. Setup for Messaging Extension Auth
Refer to [Bot SSO Setup document](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/bot-conversation-sso-quickstart/BotSSOSetup.md).

1) Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

1) If you are using Visual Studio
   - Launch Visual Studio
   - File -> Open -> Project/Solution
   - Navigate to `samples/msgext-search-auth-config/csharp` folder
   - Select `TeamsMessagingExtensionsSearchAuthConfig.csproj` or `TeamsMessagingExtensionsSearchAuthConfig.sln`file

1) Run ngrok - point to port 3978 (You can skip this step, if you have already run ngrok while doing SSO setup)

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

1) Update the `appsettings.json` configuration for the bot to use the MicrosoftAppId, MicrosoftAppPassword, MicrosoftAppTenantId generated in Step 1 (App Registration creation). (Note the App Password is referred to as the "client secret" in the azure portal and you can always create a new client secret anytime.)
    - Set "MicrosoftAppType" in the `appsettings.json`. (**Allowed values are: MultiTenant(default), SingleTenant, UserAssignedMSI**)
    - Set "ConnectionName" in the `appsettings.json`. The Microsoft Entra ID ConnectionName from the OAuth Connection Settings on Azure Bot registration
    - Set "SiteUrl" in the `appsettings.json`. The ngrok forwarding url (ie `https://xxxx.ngrok-free.app`) from starting ngrok and if you are using dev tunnels, your URL will be like: https://12345.devtunnels.ms.

1) Run your bot, either from Visual Studio with `F5` or using `dotnet run` in the appropriate folder.

1) __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the  `AppManifest` folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your bot earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID>>` (depending on the scenario the MicrosoftAppId may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` with base Url domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `AppManifest` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)
    - **Upload** the `manifest.zip` to Teams (In Teams Apps/Manage your apps click "Upload an app". Browse to and Open the .zip file. At the next dialog, click the Add button.)

**Note**: If you are facing any issue in your app, please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/meetings-sidepanel/nodejs/server/index.js#L48) line and put your debugger for local debug.

## Running the sample

Once the Messaging Extension is installed, click the icon for **Config Auth Search** in the Compose Box's Messaging Extension menu to display the search window. Left click to choose **Settings** and view the Sign-In page.

**Adding bot UI:**
