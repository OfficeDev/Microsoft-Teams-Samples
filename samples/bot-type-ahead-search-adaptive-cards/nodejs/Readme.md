# Typeahead search control in Adaptive Cards Node.js

This sample shows the feature of typeahead search (static, dynamic and dependant) control in Adaptive Cards.

## Included Features
* Bots
* Adaptive Cards (typeahead search)

## Interaction with bot

 ## Try it yourself - experience the App in your Microsoft Teams client
Please find below demo manifest which is deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading the app package (.zip file link below) to your teams and/or as a personal app. (Uploading must be enabled for your tenant, [see steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)).

**Typeahead search control in Adaptive Cards:** [Manifest](/samples/bot-type-ahead-search-adaptive-cards/csharp/demo-manifest/Typeahead-search-adaptive-cards.zip)

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) latest version or equivalent tunnelling solution
- [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) or [TeamsFx CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/teamsfx-cli?pivots=version-one)

## Run the app (Using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio Code)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio Code.

1. Ensure you have downloaded and installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)
1. Install the [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension)
1. Select **File > Open Folder** in VS Code and choose this samples directory from the repo
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the app in a Teams web client.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.

> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (uploading), Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

## Setup

### Register your app with Azure AD.

  1. Register a new application in the [Microsoft Entra ID – App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.
  2. Select **New Registration** and on the *register an application page*, set following values:
      * Set **name** to your app name.
      * Choose the **supported account types** (any account type will work)
      * Leave **Redirect URI** empty.
      * Choose **Register**.
  3. On the overview page, copy and save the **Application (client) ID, Directory (tenant) ID**. You'll need those later when updating your Teams application manifest and in the appsettings.json.
  4. Navigate to **API Permissions**, and make sure to add the follow permissions:
   Select Add a permission
      * Select Add a permission
      * Select Microsoft Graph -\> Delegated permissions.
      * `User.Read` (enabled by default)
      * Click on Add permissions. Please make sure to grant the admin consent for the required permissions.

2. Setup for Bot
- In Azure portal, create a [Azure Bot resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-authentication?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp%2Caadv2).
- Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
- While registering the bot, use `https://<your_tunnel_domain>/api/messages` as the messaging endpoint.
**NOTE:** When you create app registration, you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.

3. Setup NGROK
 - Run ngrok - point to port 3978

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

4. Setup for code
  - Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

- Update the `.env` configuration for the bot to use the `MicrosoftAppId` and `MicrosoftAppPassword` (Note the MicrosoftAppId is the AppId created in step 1 (Setup for Bot), the MicrosoftAppPassword is referred to as the "client secret" in step 1 (Setup for Bot) and you can always create a new client secret anytime.)

-Also, set MicrosoftAppType in the `.env`. (**Allowed values are: MultiTenant(default), SingleTenant, UserAssignedMSI**)

- In a terminal, navigate to `samples/bot-type-ahead-search-adaptive-cards/nodejs`

- Install modules

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
- Run your bot at the command line:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
- __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the  `appManifest` folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your bot earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID>>` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` with base Url domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `appManifest` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)
    - **Upload** the `manifest.zip` to Teams (In Teams Apps/Manage your apps click "Upload an app". Browse to and Open the .zip file. At the next dialog, click the Add button.)
    - Add the app in personal/groupchat/team scope (supported scopes)

**Note**: If you are facing any issue in your app, please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/bot-type-ahead-search-adaptive-cards/nodejs/index.js#L44) line and put your debugger for local debug.

## Running the sample

Use the bot command `staticsearch` to get the card with static typeahead search control and use bot command `dynamicsearch` to get the card with dynamic typeahead search control.

 `Static search:` Static typeahead search allows users to search from values specified within `input.choiceset` in the Adaptive Card payload.

![5](Images/5.SelectedOption.png)

`Dynamic search:` Dynamic typeahead search is useful to search and select data from large data sets. The data sets are loaded dynamically from the dataset specified in the card payload.

![7](Images/7.DynamicSearch2.png)

![8](Images/8.SelectedDynamicSearch.png)

On `Submit` button click, the bot will return the choice that we have selected.

`Dependant Dropdown search:`
 Dependant typeahead search allows users to select data based on one of the dropdown. If the data of the main dropdown changes the data of the dependant dropdown changes with it. The data sets are loaded dynamically from the dataset specified in the card payload.
