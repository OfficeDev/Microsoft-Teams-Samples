 ## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account (not a guest account)
- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 6.0

  ```bash
  # determine dotnet version
  dotnet --version
  ```
- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) latest version or equivalent tunneling solution
- [M365 developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) or access to a Teams account with the 
- [Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)

## Run the app (Using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio)

The simplest way to run this sample in Teams is to use Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio.
1. Install Visual Studio 2022 **Version 17.10 Preview 4 or higher** [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
1. Install Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio [Teams Toolkit extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/toolkit-v4/install-teams-toolkit-vs?pivots=visual-studio-v17-7)
1. In the debug dropdown menu of Visual Studio, select Dev Tunnels > Create A Tunnel (set authentication type to Public) or select an existing public dev tunnel.
1. In the debug dropdown menu of Visual Studio, select default startup project > **Microsoft Teams (browser)**
1. In Visual Studio, right-click your **TeamsApp** project and **Select Teams Toolkit > Prepare Teams App Dependencies**
1. Using the extension, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account where you have permissions to upload custom apps.
1. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or **F5** to run the menu in Visual Studio.
1. In the browser that launches, select the **Add** button to install the app to Teams.
> If you do not have permission to upload custom apps (sideloading), Teams Toolkit will recommend creating and using a Microsoft 365 Developer Program account - a free program to get your own dev environment sandbox that includes Teams.

 ## Setup

 > Note these instructions are for running the sample on your local machine, the tunnelling solution is required because
 the Teams service needs to call into the bot.

1. Register a new application in the [Microsoft Entra ID â€“ App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.
    
2. Setup for Bot
  - Register a Microsoft Entra ID aap registration in Azure portal.
  - Also, register a bot with Azure Bot Service, following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration?view=azure-bot-service-3.0).
  - Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
  - While registering the bot, use `https://<your_tunnel_domain>/api/messages` as the messaging endpoint.

    > NOTE: When you create your app registration, you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.

3. Setup NGROK
 - Run ngrok - point to port 3978

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

4. Setup for code

  - Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```
   - Update channelID placeholer `<AddYourTeamsChannelId>` value in your `DeepLinkBot.cs` file with your particular channel id from any Team in Teams. (You can get it manually by clicking on 3 dots in any team's channel and fetch it's link and extract the channel id ) like `General` channel) Example: `19:cbe3683f25094106b826c9cada3afbe0@thread.skype`

   - Navigate to `wwwroot/js/env.js` file and update your AppId at placeholder `<<App-ID>>` (You can get it manually frrm [teams admin portal](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/).
	- ![personal-AddedBot ](DeepLinkBot/images/TeamsAdminPortal.png)
   
   - Update the `appsettings.json` configuration for the bot to use the MicrosoftAppId, MicrosoftAppPassword, BaseURL ,
	ChannelEntityId is a unique identifier ,TabEntityId as EntityId from Manifest file ,MannifestAppId as manifest ID from manifest file,
	generated in Step 1 (App Registration creation). (Note the App Password is referred to as the "client secret" 
	in the azure portal and you can always create a new client secret anytime.)
    - Also, set MicrosoftAppType in the `appsettings.json`. (**Allowed values are: MultiTenant(default), SingleTenant, UserAssignedMSI**)

  - If you are using Visual Studio
    - Launch Visual Studio
    - File -> Open -> Project/Solution
    - Navigate to `samples/Tab-deeplink/csharp` folder
    - Select `DeeplinkBot.csproj` or `DeeplinkBot.sln`file
    - Run your bot, either from Visual Studio with `F5` or using `dotnet run` in the appropriate folder.

5. __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the  `appPackage` folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your bot earlier) *everywhere* 
	  you see the place holder string `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID>>` value(depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json` and `${{BOT_DOMAIN}}` with base Url domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be `12345.devtunnels.ms`.
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` with base Url domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.
	**Note:** If you want to test your app across multi hub like: Outlook/Office.com, please update the `manifest.json` in the `tab-deeplink\csharp\DeepLinkBot\AppManifest_Hub` folder with the required values.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `Manifest` folder to create a `Manifest.zip` or `AppManifest_Hub` folder into a `AppManifest_Hub.zip`. (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)
    - **Upload** the `manifest.zip` to Teams (In Teams Apps/Manage your apps click "Upload an app". Browse to and Open the .zip file. At the next dialog, click the Add button.)
    - Add the app to personal/team/groupChat scope (Supported scopes)

**Note**: If you are facing any issue in your app, please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/tab-deeplink/csharp/DeepLinkBot/AdapterWithErrorHandler.cs#L26) line and put your debugger for local debug.
